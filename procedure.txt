**BELOW DESCRIBE THE ROUGH PROCEDURE OF OUR APPLICATION"

1. Given a question, we first embed it using BERT embedding

2. Then, we search K question embeddings (in our dataset) that is closest 
   to this question embedding. The question embeddings will be returned as long
   as the similarity is above a threshold P.

2.1 If there's no question embeddings that is closest to the question embedding, we 
    tell the user we cannot find anything

3. Then, we return the top 1 answer. If the user is not satisfied, we give them another one.
   If we ran out of similar question to give, we tell them we cannot find anything (same as 2.1)

After these, we can make a nice user-interface on the web

Optioanlly, we can use our own voices that makes the question-answering bot talk with our voices

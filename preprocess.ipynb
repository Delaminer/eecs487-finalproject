Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for /p t k/ and 90, 95, and 125 for /pʰ tʰ kʰ/.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This is also confirmed from my anecdotal explorations in the topic.</p>\\n\\n<p>The question I have is what causes the different stop consonants to have different VOTs. I couldn\\'t find any good linguistic descriptions through some preliminary googling.</p>\\n\\n<p>The two hypotheses I had were both based on the (my own) idea that voicing begins once air pressure subsides from high stop-like levels to some trigger point.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first hypothesis was that air from a far back pressure release has to travel farther and through more obstructed corridors to reach the open air. Whereas air from a /p/ release can immediately and quickly reach the open, air from a /k/ release has to go all the way through the mouth to get outside. The latter trek is slow and results in a slower decrease of air pressure resulting in a later trigger for voicing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The second hypothesis was that somehow, the backer points of articulation resulted in higher pressure buildups. This would be plausible if stop bursts required some given mass of extra air to release, and this mass, distributed over the oral cavity in /p/ would be spread over a larger volume and consequently have a lower pressure than in /k/. Thereafter, even if air pressure subsided at the same rate, the higher original pressure in /k/ would take longer to hit the trigger point.</p>\\n\\n<p>Are there any good readings on the subject or anybody who can provide a more confident explanation?</p>\\n',\n",

It is specially seen in the word <em>embromation</em>, that comes from the verb <em>embromar</em>, something like “to deceive”. The morpheme <em>-ation</em> transforms it into a noun used to describe bad English. It can also be added to any other word to give it an “English quality”, always in a funny way and making reference to one\\'s poor mastering of English. Although it is certainly not part of the standard Portuguese, it is recognized by almost any speaker and has been used in language school advertisement.

My notion of morphology and consequently morphemes comes from Steven Pinker\\'s pretheoretical <em>Words and Rules</em>. He considers morphology to be separated from syntax and responsible for the “rules for forming complex words, including regulars” (page 23). Its main job is to make it possible to join lexicon elements, such as words and morphemes, together, thus saving us from the trouble of memorizing the past form for every verb, for example. Rather than defining morphemes, I will only say that they are the set of memorized chunks that affixes such as <em>-ation</em> (as in “affiliation”), <em>un-</em> (“unthinkable”) and <em>-s</em> (“dogs”) belong to.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, it is quite natural that a language will borrow morphemes (and lexicon, syntax etc.) from the language(s) it came from. I would say that my main interest are those cases in which the borrowing had little to do with political imposition of a language (like Ancient Rome did in most cases, or Spain in its colonies) or linguistic evolution and heritage. Rather, I\\'m looking for morphemes borrowed because of the need of expression that morpheme would cover.</p>\\n\\n<p>To conclude, I don\\'t have any specific definition for morpheme, nor am I too concerned with the issues the concept brings; also, “pure” borrowings constitute stronger evidence than “forced” ones.</p>\\n',\n",

The reason why I\\'m asking this question again is because I would like to dissociate this question from the purely historical question, for any particular language, of whether it has an identifiable origin. The fact that most languages of interest to linguists do not have an identifiable origin, and (dialects unwittingly created via enlightenment projects in received pronunciation and grammatical proscriptions notwithstanding) were not strongly affected by deliberate attempts to engineer, design, or otherwise modify the language, is not obviously pertinent.</p>\\n\\n<p>For the purposes of this question, \"a vernacular\" means a language which it makes sense to study in a descriptivist manner: a language which is or was actually <em>used</em>, as opposed to a mere rule-set. I choose this word based on remarks in the other question, where it\\'s fairly clear that regular use by a community (for whom that language is a vernacular, as opposed to a formal or ritual, language) is likely to be a key criterion.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">American Sign Language</a> is an interesting case study: while derived in large part from a pre-existing sign language which evolved in the wild in Paris, it was viewed with disdain for some time, until it was \"<em>proven [to be a natural language] to the satisfaction of the linguistic community by William Stokoe</em>\". Ignoring the reference to \"natural language\", this demonstrates that, historically, there have been cases where there was doubt as to whether some particular language was a genuine vernacular (as opposed perhaps to some sort of \"bad gesturing imitation\", <em>i.e.</em>&nbsp;a manual pidgin) but that it was possible to convince others that it was a genuine example of a language suitable for linguistic study.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Question.</strong> Is there a consensus as to what criteria a language must have in order to be considered \"a vernacular\" (in the practical sense of being a language within the proper domain of the study of linguistics)?

(...although there is always the problem of how to distinguish evidence from facts, because can\\'t any fact count as evidence towards some claim?)</p>\\n\\n<p>But I\\'ve always had difficulty understanding how to empirically distinguish between the two readings. The standard example used to illustrate the difference is Kratzer 1991\\'s \\'hydrangeas\\' example:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>(1) Context</strong>: You go to a new land, and test the climate and soil, finding out that it\\'s pretty much the same as the climate and soil at home, where hydrangeas grow. You know, however, that this new land has had no contact with Asia or America (and thus hydrangeas could not have possibly spread to this new land)</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>a)    Hydrangeas can grow here.<br>\\n    b)    There might be hydrangeas growing here.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In the context, (1a) is true, but (1b) is false, showing that (1a) and (1b) have distinct meanings, which could be characterized in terms of the types of facts used to make the claims (i.e., that (1a) only is concerned with the physical facts, concerning the soil, climate and the physical properties of hydrangeas, and doesn\\'t care about your evidence that the land in question has had no contact with Asia or America, whereas (1b) cannot discount this evidence). But the problem is that there is also a distinction between (1a) and (1b) with respect to the temporal orientation — the \\'epistemic\\' reading is associated with present orientation (i.e., we\\'re considering the possibility of a current hydrangea-growing-situation), while the \\'circumstantial\\' is associated with future orientation (i.e., we\\'re considering the possibility of a future hydrangea-growing situation). </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So my question is as follows</strong>: are there any clear examples showing an epistemic-circumstantial distinction that do not also involve this temporal distinction? (Maybe in other words, what sorts of empirical data motivate the theoretical distinction between epistemic and circumstantial modals?)</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Post-answer Reassessment:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Ah thanks, those are good examples!

       "  'body': '<p><strong>Affix hopping</strong> is a morphological operation by which an unattached affix in the <code>T</code> position is lowered onto a verb. This attachment is done by the \"Phonetic Form component\" (the posited component in the mind that transforms the inputs it receives from the syntactic component into phonetic spell-outs). For example:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The boy kicks the ball.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The underlying syntax tree for this sentence can be represented as:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jtyG8.png\" alt=\"The boy kicks the ball\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Here, the suffix <em>-s</em> (that indicates third person, singular, present tense) has been taken from its original position and then attached to the end of the verb, producing the form <em>kicks</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Head movement</strong> is another operation, by which the head of a phrase is moved (in fact, copied) from its original position to another one. This is a syntactic operation. An example of head moving for a question in English:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Will you marry me?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>which can be syntactically represented as:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvkmE.png\" alt=\"Will you marry me?\"></p>\\n\\n<p>In this case, the auxiliary <em>will</em> has been moved from its original position to become attached to the null complementizer that marks a question.</p>\\n\\n<p>Both operations involve moving a head from one position to another. But affix hopping is assumed to occur at a different level (or different \"mind component\") than head movement. What is the fundamental difference that makes linguists classify these two apparently similar kinds of movements as two very distinct operations?</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '<p>Animacy has come up in a few recent questions, especially in comparison to gender. One interesting thing that turned up in the comments on those questions was whether or not animacy can sometimes be purely grammatical.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Let me compare with gender which is more familiar.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Natural gender and grammatical gender are two different things.</p>\\n\\n<p>Natural gender is not abstract or arbitrarily assigned. This is when language reflects the sex of things, mostly people and higher animals. English has natural gender in pronouns etc: \"he\", \"she\", \"him\", \"her\", \"his\". Some languages have only one third person pronoun regardless of the sex of the person etc referred to.</p>\\n\\n<p>Natural gender is not lexical. It refers directly to the sex of the thing referred to and not the word representing the thing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Grammatical gender is abstract or arbitrarily assigned. This is when every word is assigned a class such as \"masculine\", \"feminine\", \"neuter\", \"common\". These assignments are mostly not related to sex but may be related to the sound of the word or may be utterly arbitrary. Words for inanimate objects are very often assigned to the \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" class and animate objects are sometimes assigned to the \"neuter\" (sexless) class, for example German \"Fräulein\" is a neuter word for \"girl\", not feminine as would be expected under natural gender.</p>\\n\\n<p>Grammatical gender is lexical. It refers to the word representing the thing and not to the thing directly. Two synonyms referring to the same thing rrcan have different genders. For example there are two Spanish words for \"star\". \"El astro\" is masculine and \"La estrella\" is feminine.</p>\\n\\n<p>It helps to differentiate the words \"gender\" and \"sex\" when talking about this topic. \"Gender\" was originally a grammatical term only and came to become a synonym for sex later.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is another phenomenon often confused with grammatical gender. I might call it \"semantic gender\" but there\\'s probably a real term for it. In English all ships tend to be referred to as \"her\", but this is not lexical, does not depend on the word used for the ship. Languages with grammatical gender may use different genders for \"schooner\", \"destroyer\", \"carrier\", and \"battleship\".</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So, is animacy ever in any language grammatical? That is to say does it have the properties of being a) abstract/arbitrarily assigned and b) lexical?</strong></p>\\n',\n",

How can one decide whether those affixes are really true affixes or clitics in such languages? Since affixes belong to the morphology of a language, while clitics typically are described as part of the syntax of that language, it\\'s an important distinction to make.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me give you an example of why I find this question both extremely interesting and yet difficult to solve: the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Basque</a> language is an agglutinative language with a rich declension system (see an example <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/etxe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The behaviour of those declensions is AFAIK best explained if they are considered affixes, as a typical declension features instances of:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Suppletion (the definite absolutive plural is an unanalysable <em>-ak</em>);</li>\\n<li>Conditional epenthesis and elision: the dative <em>-i</em> and the cases starting with <em>-e-</em> both take an epenthetic <em>-r-</em> when added after a vowel, including the singular article <em>-a</em>, but <em>not</em> after the plural article <em>-e</em>. Moreover, the plural article actually disappears before the case suffixes in <em>-e-</em>, so that the only distinction between the indefinite and the plural is the presence or absence of the epenthetic <em>-r-</em>;</li>\\n<li>Other weird behaviours: the local cases are a weird bunch. Unlike the other cases, adding them to the stem directly doesn\\'t form the indefinite but the singular (except the inessive <em>-n</em> which does take the singular article). To form the indefinite, one has to add <em>-ta-</em> between the stem and the ending. And even more strangely, this <em>-ta-</em> element must also appear between the plural article and the local case ending!</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Yet the Basque affixes do also behave in ways we expect more of clitics or separate postpositions:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>They only appear on the last element of a noun phrase, or <em>on the last element of a series of coordinated noun phrases</em>. E.g.: <em>aita altu eta haur txikiarekin</em>: with the tall father and the small child (where <em>-a</em>: \"the\" and <em>-(r)ekin</em>: \"with\" appearing only on <em>txiki</em>: \"small\")</li>\\n<li>They can be stacked on top of each other, a phenomenon called \"surdéclinaison\" in French. E.g.: <em>Ponetarekilakoarekin</em>: <em>poneta-a-(r)ekila-ko-a-(r)ekin</em>: beret-ART-COM-GEN.LOC-ART-COM: \"with the one who is wearing the beret\"</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>I hope that with this example it\\'s now clear why I\\'m asking this question. I find the distinction between clitics/particles and affixes nebulous at best, and would love to get some clarification. Thanks in advance for your insights!</p>\\n',\n",

Over-simplifying a bit, the approach they follow can be summarized as follows. They begin by restricting their attention to a given number of most frequently occurring symbols in the corpus, and calculate the conditional entropy of pairs of symbols for this subset. (Conditional entropy in this context quantifies how well one can predict the next symbol, given only the current symbol. Low conditional entropy means the current symbol is a good predictor of the next symbol.)

The Adem people are seen by outsiders as fidgety, silent people because the signed language can be used alone for brief exchanges, but it is also used while speaking. It adds nuance to meaning, intention, intensity and emotion. There is a man in the town that lost three of his fingers as a mercenary, and he is basically seen as being mute. The Ademic spoken language is said to be more \"open\" (a small lexicon of broadly defined words?) than other languages, and one can only be understood clearly when pairing the hand language with it.</p></li>\\n<li><p>In <em><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/amber-spyglass-philip-pullman/1100014503\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Amber Spyglass</a></em> (Book 3 in <em>His Dark Materials</em>) by Philip Pullman, there is another world populated by animals called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_and_creatures_in_His_Dark_Materials#Mulefa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mulefa</a> (pl; sg: zalif) which have prehensile trunks like elephants. Their language is a combination of sounds and a swinging movement of their trunks in a particular direction, ie the same sound can mean something different if the trunk flicks a different direction. I always drew the parallel to tonal languages. The human who visits this world has to swing her arm to mimic their trunks because the movement is essential to the language. </p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>There are, of course, many instances where body language plays a role in communication, but I think the idea of it being part of the language is unique. Besides sign languages, I don\\'t think that there are real languages that operate like this, but I\\'ve been trying to think of examples where <strong>signs or physical cues inject new (non-redundant, ha), concrete information into a conversation</strong>. Here\\'s what I\\'ve come up with: </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Nodding or shaking one\\'s head (without language to accompany it)</li>\\n<li>Pointing (without deictic phrases like \"over there\")</li>\\n<li>The \"shh\" finger without the \"shh\"</li>\\n<li>Greeting and parting gestures like waving, offering a handshake, bowing, etc (Usually would not occur without some language, but could?)</li>\\n<li>Making \"typing hands\" while saying something like \"So then I said...\" automatically puts the conversation being referred to on a computer</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>This last one, although kind of a silly example, is more what I\\'m thinking of. The other examples here are all part of the mechanics of a conversation: things that are really common or culturally part of the routine of talking. But \"typing hands\" adds <strong>entirely new content to the conversation</strong>: where and how they conversation took place. Neat!</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m steering away from \"body language\" type cues like eye rolling, shrugging, or crossed arms which will more often reference the conversation itself, not what the conversation is about. </p>\\n\\n<p>Anything come to mind?</p>\\n',\n",

I speak English and German fluently myself, but I can read German texts significantly faster than English ones. I also use sometimes speed reading techniques (depending on known/unknown topic, skimming a longer text) and it seems to me that especially here the capitalization of nouns works like syntax-highlighting, which obviously is highly useful. German philologists seem split on the question of whether capitalization has more advantages than disadvantages.</p>\\n\\n<p>One consideration for me is that we actually seem mainly to focus on the first letters of a word with our eyes to recognize and memorize it (<a href=\"https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/691/how-do-we-perceive-and-read-words-and-sentences-does-the-order-of-the-inner-lett\">see this question</a>) or skim smaller words in fixed and frequently occurring word groups (e.g. \"at the beginning\").  Speed reading techniques say you should also focus on words when moving your focus from right to left and so double-scan the text.</p>\\n\\n<p>So are my assumptions backed by research results?

       "  'body': '<p>One of the most controversial ideas put forth in linguistics is the idea of <em>linguistic determinism</em>. Also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, it states that people who speak different languages would also have different mental models of the world. The classical example is the Hopi language, which, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;lpg=PP3&amp;dq=Language%20Thought%20and%20Reality%3A&amp;pg=PA57\">according to Benjamin Whorf</a>, had “no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call ‘time’.” So, because of this feature of their language, they are presumably less concerned with past, present and future, and more concerned with a “cyclic” view of time. This idea has gained a lot of attention since its first publication, especially in popular science magazines.</p>\\n\\n<p>But despite its popular appeal, this hypothesis has not yet been proven. In <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vCDX54DlYBYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20stuff%20of%20thought&amp;pg=PT155\">one experiment</a> &ndash; among many of the same kind &ndash; Tzeltal speakers, whose language does not have words for “right” or “left”, were blindfolded, spun in a chair and then asked to retrieve a coin that had been in one of two boxes. Their performance was the same both when boxes were placed on the floor (a geocentric reference) and when the boxes were placed on the end of a beam that was attached to the chair (an egocentric reference). In other words, the lack of right/left distinction in the language does not impair their ability to make that distinction in the world. This experiment was designed to refute an earlier one, which suggested the opposite, but had some methodological flaws.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, some studies show a deep influence of language on thought. One of them suggests that people <a href=\"http://www.cogsci.northwestern.edu/cogsci2004/papers/paper575.pdf\">estimate time duration differently</a>, according to the spatio-temporal metaphors found in their respective languages. For example, English speakers, who normally conceive time as a distance (\"a long time ago\", \"a short interval\", etc), are better at estimating how much time a growing line projected on a computer screen takes to reach the other side. Conversely, Spanish speakers, who normally conceive time as a quantity (“mucho tiempo”, etc) score higher when estimating the time it takes for a “container of water” to fill up on the screen. The important thing here is that both stimuli and responses are non-linguistic.</p>\\n\\n<p>The influence on thought suggested by this last study is, of course, very small. But at least, it shows an example of influence of the “strong” type, that is, linguistic features affecting non-linguistic behavior. Is there further evidence in support of this type of strong determinism?</p>\\n',\n",

But where you can investigate and find out different <strong>phenomenological factors and properties</strong>, how our mental lexicon is structured. (Neurolinguistics tries to explain this phenomenology structurally)</p>\\n<p><strong>So i gave Hauser (myself) 1 min time and a tag-keyword to say as many words as fast/spontaneous as possible and recorded them</strong> (e.g. Windows Sound recorder on your Desktop). I started with <em>verbs</em>. 1 min time. This went pretty good, around 100 of verbs i recorded. Same with <em>nouns</em>. Also pretty good, not surprising. How about <em>adverbs</em>. Hmm, it gets tricky. My brain didn\\'t seem to have a crystal clear tag here. Additionally it was hard to think just of single adverbs and not adjectives (to deduce the adverb) or verbs often used with a adverb. How about <em>locations</em>? Pretty easy, many cities i could tell or places i have been. Then i thought about terms like <em>Zeitgeist</em>. You cant really define a good clear tag-name for words of this category. PROBABLY, because it is a very abstract term with contextual meaning. A lot of scientific terms are abstract, so how about <em>quantities in natural sciences</em>. Went good, as i have some background here. Interestingly, on the &quot;verbs&quot; tag it seems common to list a lot of related verbs for maybe 10 seconds (<em>running, skiing, climbing, walking...</em>) till you stop and then quickly switch to verbs related to e.g. the sub-tag &quot;cooking&quot; (<em>cook, eat, smack,...</em>).</p>\\n<p>So what can <strong>I deduce</strong> from such results (?) There seem to be words pretty good structured and tagged in clouds and sub-clouds (like verbs, nouns), also abstract words of your personal experience (education, hobbies etc.). Even if you might not use them more than others (e.g. prepositions) ,they seem to be tagged, while <em>prepositions</em> you use in nearly every sentence, are hard to think of spontaneously and better recognized in a distinct phrase they are often used in, there doesn\\'t seem to exist a <em>preposition</em> tag in the mental lexicon (?). So visual things and activities (objects in real world and motor activities) seem to be much better tagged vs. abstract and not directly perceivable words.</p>\\n<p>To me it was a nice little experiment I would like to continue, with some tips, how this can be done the most productive and objective way to gain further phenomenological hints, how words and phrases are stored in the mental lexicon and contribute to linguistic topics like sentence building or TOT.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>So what I\\'m asking for (which fits IMHO <strong>one</strong> question, because of link of theory - exp. method):</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>What are current most investigated and favored models (technical termini) concerning the question &quot;How is our mental lexicon structured?&quot; that are similar to my self-invented experiment above recording a &quot;spatial&quot; map of tags/word-groups of my personal mental lexicon</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>How do professional linguistic research experiments differ from my self-invented exp. described above? What are common phenomenological properties/quantities investigated in such experiments (e.g. semantic proximity), which exist on different human mental lexicons, in such tests? I would think, there have been done experiments recording really big mental lexicons of students and plotting them 2-dimensionally?</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Nathan\\'s answer is spot on and exactly what I\\'m asking for. Maybe you or anybody else can add some further details (papers), which cover similar experiments (to get a foot in the door), esp. how diff. mental lexicons differ between single persons.

In other words, the Proto-Indo-European speakers conceived a hundred essentially as a ten-ness (of tens).</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691058873\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Anthony, 2007</a></strong>: <em>*ḱṃtóm</em> means (a unit of) tens. So, the combination of these two morphemes (*<em>deḱṃ</em> + *<em>ḱṃtóm</em>), meaning \"ten units of ten\", would have given rise to <em>*(de)ḱṃtóm</em>.</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://indo-european.info/a-grammar-of-modern-indo-european-third-edition.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quiles and López-Menchero, 2011</a></strong>: The tens were normally formed with the units followed by the suffix *<em>-dḱṃta</em> (\"group of ten\"). For example, thirty is <em>*trídḱṃta</em> (*<em>tri</em> + *<em>-dḱṃta</em>). According to this analysis, the word for hundred was formed by *<em>deḱṃ</em> + *<em>-dḱṃta</em>, which somehow produced the word <em>*(d)ḱṃtóm</em>.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>These three explanations are very similar, but they also seem to be slightly different from each other. Are they really different or (what is probably the case) am I missing the big picture here?</p>\\n',\n",

One thing called my attention in the book:  he spends a great deal of effort trying to show  how scholars have examined the history of English and yet failed to explain why certain features have appeared. He concentrates particularly on the arising of the <em>do</em>-support and the present progressive construction, two innovations not shared by any other Germanic language. I quote from the middle of p. 10: </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\\u2003\\u2003And yet specialists in the history of English sincerely believe that English started using <em>do</em> and <em>-ing</em> by itself, and that it is irrelevant, or virtually so, that Welsh and Cornish have the same features.  You can page through countless books and articles on The History of English, and even on specifically the history of meaningless <em>do</em> or the <em>-ing</em> present, and find Celtic either not mentioned at all, actively dismissed, or, at best, mentioned in passing as a “a possible influence” (read: of no significant bearing upon the issue).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>His point is, of course, that these constructions were introduced into English by the indigenous Celtic speakers, who lived alongside the Anglo-Saxons for centuries. My first reaction to his criticism was: \"Yes, he is right! How could linguists have not seen this obvious causal relation?\" </p>\\n\\n<p>But every science has to clearly define its scope. And, perhaps, it is not part of the field of Historical Linguistics to try to explain phenomena, but merely to describe them, based on direct evidence (which is not the case in the Celtic influence issue).

The speaker wishes for a totally ambiguous language where they can use one sound to mean everything, and leave the difficulty of disambiguation for the listener. The listener, on the other hand, wishes for a totally unambiguous language, so the difficulty of picking the right words is on the speaker, and the listener doesn\\'t need to spend energy on disambiguation.

As Karlsson persuasively argues, full blown recursion developed in the historical period. I will assume this here, and I will not repeat Karlsson\\'s arguments.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Hebrew bible, there is no more than one embedded clause in any given sentence, consistent with Karlsson\\'s bound for pre-literate societies, and there are grammar errors which suggest that the authors had a problem with complex sentences. As Karlsson explains, Greek and Latin writers developed full blown center-recursion explicitly somewhere around the 1st and 2nd centuries BC, and there is no evidence that recursion existed before then in any form</p>\\n\\n<h3>Hypothesis</h3>\\n\\n<p>As recursive embedding becomes common, it is possible that speakers prefer constructions which allow embedded clauses to take on different roles with no internal modifications. If you say</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I walked home-ward quickly</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>and you try to modify home to the embedded noun-phrase \"the wide-open field where John slaughtered the goat\", you say</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I walked <em>wide-open field-ward where John slaughtered the goat</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>this requires inserting a syllable in the <em>middle</em> of the noun-phrase \"wide-open field where John slaughtered the goat\". If you want to move the noun-phrase to the subject position of a different sentence, you need to scan the interior of the noun-phrase to remove the case-modifier:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>The wide-open field where John slaughtered the goat</em> is pretty.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>If you have a stand-alone preposition, no scan is required</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I walked to <em>the wide open field where John slaughtered the goat</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>the words past \"to\" are exactly the same as when the noun-phrase is in the subject role. If the preposition can appear at the beginning of the phrase, it gives a clear \"push\" indicator for a mechanical parser, and it allows for trivial transformation of phrases to different roles.</p>\\n\\n<p>compare the cased:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I walked store-from-ly <em>the wide open sheep grazing field-ward where John slaughtered the goat</em>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Store from-ly means \"from the store\" in a case approximation in English.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I walked <em>the wide open sheep grazing field-from-ly where John slaughtered the goat</em> store-ward.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>to the uncased:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>I walked from the store to the wide open sheep grazing field where John slaughtered the goat.</p></li>\\n<li><p>I walked to the store from the wide open sheep grazing field where John slaughtered the goat.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>There is no internal scan of the noun-phrases required in order to change their function. the words stay the same as the noun-phrase takes on different roles, only the preposition changes.</p>\\n\\n<p>The case-introducing/case-removing noun-phrase scan is really annoying. It is computationally taxing, and I believe that it creates a linguistic pressure to remove cases from a language, and replace these with prepositions. When there are no cases, you have effortless noun-phrase embedding--- you just change the preposition, which always appears at the beginning.</p>\\n\\n<p>I personally witnessed case-shedding events, in modern Hebrew. In the Bible, you would always say \"Halachti le-beyto\", \"I went to-his-house\" to mean \"I went to his house\", using a possessive marker on the word \"bayit\" (house). But modern Hebrew speaker will always say \"Halachti la-bayit shelo\", \"I went to the house of him\", precisely because the word \"shel\" can be used to embed, as in \"Halachti la-bayit shel ha-ach hagadol sheli\" \"I went to the house of my big brother\".</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to a possessive marker, which was shed, Biblical Hebrew also has a \"to\" case, so that it says \"I walked Schem-ward\" (\"Halachti Schem-a\"). Modern Hebrew, despite prescriptivist admonitions, also dropped this case entirely, so that all modern speakers use the recursion friendly: \"I walked to shchem\" (\"Halachti le-Schem\").</p>\\n\\n<p>From my own native speaker intuition, I know that this is a consequence of the ubiquitous embedding in modern Hebrew. You don\\'t say \"I walked city-ward by the sea\" in modern Hebrew, it is ungrammatical. you say \"I walked to the city by the sea\", with the exact same form as in English.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Bible doesn\\'t embed very much, and if it wanted to do this, it would say it in a pre-literate way that suggests recursion is completely alien to the author: \"Halachti Schema, zu ha-\\'ir le-yad ha-yam\"/\"I walked city-ward, this is the city by the sea.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>So the hypothesis is that recursive languages shed their cases as soon as most speakers begin to produce and transform multiply embedded sentences on a regular basis. This happens at different times for different languages.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Predictions/Questions</h3>\\n\\n<p>This hypothesis makes the following predictions, and these are the questions I have:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Cases should be most diverse and pronounced in non-embedding languages, like Piraha. This is true of Piraha. Is it true of other non-embedding languages?</li>\\n<li>The most cased languages today should have a recent writing system, and the least cased languages should have an ancient writing system. For Russian and English, this works. Are there counterexamples?</li>\\n<li>Are there opposite events where the case system was strengthened? Do these correspond to a loss of literacy?</li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

I know that this grammar (or a small modification if I forgot something) covers all New York Times English, and all artificial highly embedded sentences, leaving out only:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Idioms and weird constructions: \"How do you do?\", \"hello, dear.\", \"Okeh, oops!\", etc</li>\\n<li>Tense-matching: this is a local finite property, and it doesn\\'t touch the embedding structure. It is a distracting complication. I ignored it.</li>\\n<li>Subject-verb matching: again not difficult, but distracting.</li>\\n<li>Pronoun-reference: \"With a broom, John walked on the floor, beating it.\", what does \"it\" refer to? This is a very interesting linguistic question which I ignore.</li>\\n<li>General \"and\" and \"or\": The and rules are cut-and-paste for different kinds of objects, debugging (ADVERB \"and\" ADVERB), (ADJECTIVE and ADJECTIVE), (PREPISH and PREPISH), etc, is tedious, so I skipped this.</li>\\n<li>Verb ellipsis: I am not sure when this appears in the NYT, I have not seen an example yet. Verb ellipses can be implemented on the parser level, but at the rule level it\\'s very annoying.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The central possibly new idea that I used is the notion of a commutative context-free grammar. A commutative context-free grammar allows a string of nonterminals to move to different positions in the sentence before expanding. I will illustrate with a sentence with two movable ADVERB phrases, a subject and a verb. At some stage in the generation, it looks like this:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>ADVERB+ ADVERB+ ADVERB+ (SUBJECT) (VERB OBJECT) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In the next stages, I can move ADVERB+ to the right, so long as I don\\'t go inside regions enclosed by parentheses. So I might get</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>ADVERB+ (the ADJ[] man ) ADVERB+ (takes the box) ADVERB+</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The ADVERB is a production that includes anything that attaches to the verb, including \"if\" clauses, initial \"yes\"/\"no\", and prepositional phrases that modify the action, as opposed to modifying the noun. At a later stage of production, the ADVERBs resolve to verb arguments, adverb words, or gerund phrases. So in a few steps, you get</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>With a broom (the tall man) to the big monster (takes the box) with a limp.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Then you drop parentheses and introduce commas as conventional, to get:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>With a broom, the tall man, to the big monster takes the box, with a limp.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The point of this structure is to capture the commutativity of ADVERB position in a phrase. These really can appear anywhere, and often do in poetic work, although there are style conventions in English which tends to place them at canonical positions.</p>\\n\\n<p>This idea produces a very compact BNF for the phrase structure of English, and explains why other methods don\\'t. The commutativity produces a large number of different nodes if you ignore it. I will point out that the parse description that this generates for the sentence is the same in all permutation of the ADVERBs. It\\'s still a parse tree abstractly, but the tree is not contiguously represented in the sentence. Some arguments far away are bound to distant objects.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is always a position for the ADVERBs (after the verb) where if you force the writer to place them all there, the grammar becomes context free. If you restrict the ADVERBs to the very beginning too, you can also make it context free while still producing the ADVERBs from the verb, using the following trick:</p>\\n\\n<p>define a single nonterminal symbol: ADVERBLIST_SUBJECT_VERB_ADVERBLIST, and have context free rules that spit out ADVERBs on both sides, then when you are done spitting out ADVERBs, break it into SUBJECT ADVERBLIST_VERB_ADVERBLIST, then spit out ADVERBs on both sides, then resolve ADVERBLIST_VERB_ADVERBLIST into a VERB. This allows you to artificially remove commutativity, at the cost of introducing more parse levels into the grammar. If you do it wrong, you can easily introduce new parsing ambiguity that isn\\'t there in the original sentence.</p>\\n\\n<p>Aside from being counterintuitive, a context-free reduction doesn\\'t match the arguments to the verb the correct way, which is independent of their position, this trick also doesn\\'t work in general. If you have two separate commutative lists, a list of ADJECTIVES and ADVERBs, these can commute past each other, so that if you force the grammar to be context free, you requiring an ever-growing number of nonterminals to represent the different permutations. You can probably parse all the New York Times with only a few permutations, since good style places the ADJECTIVE close to the noun it modifies, but this commutativity leads a combinatorial explosion in the representation of English that suggests that the reason is that the commutative grammar is not context free.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Formal Description</h3>\\n\\n<p>While one can define commutative grammars in extreme generality, I will restrict myself to the ones useful in English. The primitive commutation rule is a production of the form:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>A+ B: B A+</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>And likewise for all + marked variables with all unplussed variables. This allows the plus variables to move rightward, and I place them at the leftmost position they can occur.</p>\\n\\n<p>This production is not context free, it takes two objects to two other objects in the other order. But it isn\\'t going hog-wild either--- the number and type of nonterminal symbols is preserved during this transformation--- it doesn\\'t wreck the tree structure completely, it only permutes the order of the nonterminals, and the moment you expand \"B\" into something in parentheses, say:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>B: (P Q)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Then A no longer is allowed to commute with P and Q. So the commutativity is at each nesting level individually.</p>\\n\\n<p>I define a language to be commutative context-free if all comutative objects can be generated, commuted, and resolved into unplussed-variables before any other rules are applied. Further, I will only allow them to move in one direction, by convention to the right, since this is no loss of generality in the cases I am considering. Finally, I will require that any further expansion of nonterminals will always be enclosed in parentheses which provide a firm boundary to any commuting variables introduced at a deeper nesting level, so that objects at a lower level will never commute out of their level.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Questions</h3>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Is the commutative CFG in the mathematical linguistics literature? </li>\\n<li>Does anyone see a proof that the commutative CFG is strictly stronger than CFG (I am pretty sure this is true)?</li>\\n</ol>\\n',\n",

In Hakha Lai, the language I am interested in, you cannot use (most) applicatives in cases where the applicative object is less local than the theme. This is possibly because the verb wants to agree with the more local argument in general in HL, but the applicative also is highly prioritized for agreement (and other processes which enhance topicality). In the causative construction, this problem does not arise because there is default agreement with the causee.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, you cannot have a third person applicative object if the theme (direct object) is first or second person, and there is a weaker violation if the applicative is second person and the theme is first person.

       "  'body': '<p>This question occurred to me when studying Optimality Theory phonology. For reduplication in OT, the base of the stem (/reduplicated part) is taken to be the input for the reduplicated morph. However, sometimes the base and reduplicant differ. For example, if I was reduplicating a word like \"ban\" /ban-REDUP/ in a language with homorganic nasals, the result might come out as /bamban/. In OT, this is unexpected (the nasals are not in correspondence between the base and the reduplicant), although of course with a rule ordering approach one could have nasal assimilation occur later. Apparently this is also attested for processes of syncope, where in the surface form the stem has lost a vowel which the reduplicant contains. (I will find the real examples from actual languages later.) I should note, for (most?) other processes, it seems like the reduplicant <em>is</em> based off the surface form of the base. So, if the base contains an environment that triggers nasal harmony, the reduplicant will also appear nasalized even if the nasalization trigger is not copied and there is no other trigger for nasalization that could be affecting the reduplicant. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So, my question is: are certain processes more likely to be surface true cross-linguistically? If so, why? My intuition is that in some cases these effects might be phonetic, or closer to phonetic than phonological. NC assimilation and syncope certainly seem to be more \"surface-y\" and production-oriented than things like vowel/nasal harmony, etc, although I am not sure of how to formalize that intuition.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>PS I\\'m not sure whether \"reduplicant\" is the real/correct word for a reduplicated morph.

But it also has <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%83%92%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%A8%E1%83%94\">გარეშე (gareshe)</a>, which can be used as both postposition and preposition. I\\'ve also read that it has some prepositions borrowed from Russian but I haven\\'t learned any of those yet.</p>\\n\\n<p>So is this a case where \"there\\'s an exception to every rule\" and most languages turn out to have a few instance of the opposite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition\">adposition</a> to how they are usually classified, or have I chanced to bump into some of the rare exceptions?</p>\\n',\n",

For example, if you put me in some Chinese village, we couldn\\'t understand each other a word, but by interacting with people, using hands etc, as time passes I could pick some words and as time passes I\\'d probably understand the language.

It begins with a short summary of its conclusion, which contains the following sentence:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The word God is a relatively new European invention, which was never\\n  used in any of the ancient Judaeo-Christian scripture manuscripts that\\n  were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek or Latin.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I am befuddled by the fact that they seem to have overlooked a very clear source.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Genesis 30:11 - we read:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>וַתֹּאמֶר לֵאָה בגד \\\\ בָּא גָד</p>\\n  \\n  <p>And Leah said, \"<em>gad</em> has come.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Targum <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Pseudo-Jonathan\">[Pseudo-]</a>Jonathan interprets:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>וַאֲמַרַת לֵאָה אָתָא מַזְלָא טָבָא</p>\\n  \\n  <p>And Leah said, \"the good \\'mazal\\' (astrological sign / luck) has come.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I would assume that if ‘mazal’ = ‘gad’ then we could have a pretty good indication of where the word ‘god’ came from.</p>\\n\\n<p>If this isn’t good enough, note the word גדא which is mentioned several times in the Talmud. See, for example, Hullin 40a:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>אמר אביי לא קשיא הא דאמר להר הא דאמר לגדא דהר דיקא נמי דקתני דומיא\\n  דמיכאל שר הגדול</p>\\n  \\n  <p>...Abbaye said, \"it is not problematic, for this is when he said [he\\n  was slaughtering it] for the mountain and this is where he said it was\\n  for the <em>gada</em> (referring some heavenly minister that some would serve\\n  as a <em>god</em>) of the mountain...</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>It is quite clear from the context that גדא דהר means just that; god of the mountain!</p>\\n\\n<p>Does anyone have any knowledge that would help in figuring out whether or not these words (גד and god) are actually related, as they seem to be?</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '<p>What manner of theories are there on the origin of Indo-European case-like prepositions (usually; they were originally postpositions, and a handful of languages still have postpositions)? They seem like a rather unusual breed of word, linguistically, in that they can seemingly act as both particles and adverbs as far back as PIE. This duality is especially evident in the fact that as particles they are free-standing words in all IE languages I know of, while in PIE and some modern IE languages (English being a counter-example) the adverbial forms are bound morphemes of the verb.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thinking it over, I have two thoughts, though it\\'s possible neither is correct (if the answer is known at all). First, they could have originally been free-standing verbs. This of course suggests that pre-PIE was a serial verb language, though I guess it\\'s possible they could have been verbs of free-standing clauses (although that seems less probable).</p>\\n\\n<p>The more complicated (and I think interesting) idea is they were originally bound derivational morphemes (possibly free-standing adverbs prior to fusion with the verb), and the object of the preposition was in fact the object of the verb itself. This implies that you could at one point only have up to two parameters of a verb, rather than the ability of modern languages to have many connected to a single verb by different prepositions or cases. As such something like \"He brought it for her\" would require something like \"He brought it. [He] did-for her.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course this idea itself requires answering another question: how bound morphemes became free; usually free-standing words fuse to become bound morphemes, not the other way around. My example above sort of suggests how this might have happened: the deletion of an essentially semantically empty (and therefore redundant) verb such as \"do\", leaving the derivational morpheme standing on its own, and a resulting fusion of the two clauses into one.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or I suppose a simpler possibility would be that the differentiation between adverb and particle occurred earlier than that, and at the time the adverb had not yet fused with the verb. Thus the free-standing adverb essentially split into two different words: the original adverb that subsequently fused with the verb to become a bound morpheme, and a particle that remained a distinct word.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course it\\'s possible that that idea, while interesting, is entirely off base. Has this question been explored in more detail by other linguists?</p>\\n\\n<p>Added 9/1: Actually, I can think of a third possibility just to throw out there. If we assume that pre-PIE was more hospitable to null anaphora than modern English, it\\'s possible it had something like \"prepositions\" in Totonac. In Totonac, \"prepositions\" are actually bound morphemes of the verb (and there can be more than one such morpheme per verb), and the prepositional objects are themselves bare noun phrases. If the verb is intransitive, the (dipersonal) verb could agree with one of the prepositional objects based on a priority system, but otherwise prepositional objects were entirely unmarked and reference was left to the intuition. If such a system existed in pre-PIE it could have evolved into true particles by such morphemes coming to be bound to their objects rather than the verb, and evolved into adverbs by analysis of null anaphora as object-less.</p>\\n',\n",

Thus the project is a combination of \"Marketing\", \"Datamining/statistics\" and \"Linguistics\". I am a marketing student and the last english class I had was 6-7 years ago. </p>\\n\\n<p>I have come so far that I need to understand what \"semantics\" (having updated this I am not so sure anymore, but I leave I for now) are related to discussions about ideas. To give a couple of examples of what I mean one could write the following idea in a forum:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>I came up with an idea of how to build a car that is fueled by water.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Another example:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Yesterday I came up with a cool idea about how to create a cure for cancer.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>My point of showing these two example is that if I was to run some statistical analysis on these two examples, the nouns \"car\", \"car\", \"water\", \"cure\" and \"cancer\" does not really contribute to whether a sentence contains what I am looking for. So I might as well throw these out. However the phrase \"came up with\" does provide a lot of information as this is one way to express that one have an idea. </p>\\n\\n<p>One could imagine several variations of these examples but my point is that basically one should be able to remove nouns as they should not make a difference in theory. Even the word \"idea\" which is also a noun one should be able to remove, but maybe one need to distinguis between nouns that is often connected to discussions about ideas and nouns in general. For example the nouns \"idea\", \"innovation\", \"design\" and \"model\" might be nouns that in some degree might show up when people discuss ideas.</p>\\n\\n<p>To give an example of why I started searching this way I have already build a model (via SVM) based on n-grams. When one create the model one obtains the weights of a given term or n-gram that contributes. When looking through that list, n-grams like <code>\"that would\"</code>, <code>\"that sounds cool\"</code>, <code>\"i have\"</code> and/or <code>\"i had an\"</code> tend to weight highly, getting me to think that dividing the text into ngrams/chunks is a part of how one should model this. </p>\\n\\n<p>As already mentioned one might have to distinguish bewteen nouns which are likely to show up when people debate ideas but unlikely to show up when people debate ideas within a given domain. I will give a couple of examples below:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>It would be a great idea to invent chocolate that make you loose weight</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>I am working with innovation and I have just come up with an\\n  idea of how to produce chocolate that makes you loose weight</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>So the following phrases/n-grams are likely to have positive weights:</p>\\n\\n<p><code>\"it would be\"</code>, <code>\"have just come up with\"</code>, <code>\"just come up with\"</code>, <code>\"come up with\"</code></p>\\n\\n<p>One could also imagine that the verb <code>\"invent\"</code> would also have positive weights.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally the nouns <code>\"idea\"</code> and <code>\"innovation\"</code> are also likely to have positive weights, but the term <code>chocolate</code> is not as it only tells us what domain of ideas we are dealing with.</p>\\n\\n<p>The case is that I was handed over 300 classified posts from a userforum where three judges had classified the posts. The posts was classified as containing an idea(1) or not (0) and if at least two of the judges agreed that there was an idea in the text I would use it as a positive case. This gives me 12 positive cases and 288 negative cases, which is of course a very bad training set far to small and unbalanced to do anything proper with. Then the thought was to use this small bad training sample to create a preliminary filter that can be used to extract around 3000 posts from the original forum with a higher likelihood of containing an idea. What I am doing now is that I am trying to optimize the preliminary filter to get a good training set for the final model.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am writing this here because I do not have a clue about how to attack this problem. I know how to setup a computer to do what I want it to, but I dont know how to work with language in a structured way. Therefore I hope that someone in here could throw me a couple of keywords and maybe even sources that I can look at myself in order to figure out how to structure my problem better. I would also be nice just to have someone to debate this with as I am totally on my own.</p>\\n',\n",

It would be interesting to know how divergent pronunciations developed, and how people pronounced certain words in earlier ages.</p>\\n\\n<p>MORE DETAILS: What I\\'m seeking is something similar to the documentation on changes in orthography and semantics that exist in etymological dictionaries for pronunciation. This by its nature is more difficult, of course; but since linguists have been able to piece out the pronunciation of the words of languages long dead, it might not be impossible.</p>\\n\\n<p>EVEN MORE DETAILS: Of course, changes in pronunciation might occur more frequently than changes in spelling, which would only add to the difficulty of the problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why I ask is that certain words in English appear to have very peculiar pronunciations - ones that strike one as not being optimal in terms of how easy it is to say them. Semi-non-native speakers (such as for instance educated people in India, where I lived for a few years) pronounce words like <strong>distribute</strong> with the emphasis on the first syllable instead of the second, which to me seems an easier way to say the word. I\\'ve even heard some native speakers, unless they speak with great care, place greater stress on the first syllable than native speakers normally do. Was it always pronounced like this? I would think that far more variation might have existed in pronunciation, as it did in spelling, before communication and writing were sufficiently developed to make something of a standard variety possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also English words tend to lack consistency in terms of pronunciation. \"Finite\" is pronounced differently when it\\'s in the word \"infinite\". \"Demoniac\" is \"dee-MOH-nee-ac\" but \"demoniacal\" is \"dee-mo-NAY-uh-cal\". Words that are very similar in terms of spelling and language of origin are nonetheless pronounced differently.

Article 2. Morphology of the noun”. <em>Scholarly notes of Tartu University</em>, issue 486. Tartu, 1979. Pp. 23—44.) and in the section about grammatical number there is passage where I am not sure how to translate certain terminology in\\xa0English. I am native Russian speaker, I just do not know the proper linguistic terms.</p>\\n\\n<p>Below is the passage from page 32 <sup>(<a href=\"https://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/handle/10062/25795/acta_486_problemy_1979.pdf?sequence=1#page=33\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rus</a>)</sup> where he talks about the general development of dual and then its extinction in Russian language, translated to the best of my ability (terms in question are emboldened, author’s own emphasis of one of the words is converted to italics by me):</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Most ancient stratum of the functioning of this form, apparently, constitute the so-called <strong>independent dual</strong> — the form used with a noun outside of combination with the numeral “two”, that is, not supported by lexical definition of quantity. Independent dual was used originally for designation of <em>paired</em> objects (“eyes”, “arms” and the like). Subsequently develops the usage of <strong>connected dual</strong> [related? bounded?] that combines the noun with the numeral “two”. As a result, the usage of\\xa0the\\xa0form of\\xa0dual grammatical number broadens, and this form becomes universal quantitative determinant that can be imparted to any noun.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>To elaborate more on “connected dual” author examples (p. 33) how relics of dual forms now differ in\\xa0meaning according to whether or not they are used with a qualifier, such as numeral “two” or pronouns “these”, “such”, “mine”, “some” <em>etc.</em> If someone says “<em>на столе лежат книги</em>” (there are books laying on the table), listener would assume a “larger multitude” of “more than two” (>2), whereas “<em>эти книги лежат на столе</em>” (these books are laying on the table) means that there could be any number of\\xa0books, including two (>1). That is, author argues that if there were, in fact, two books on the table, the\\xa0speaker is expected to note that directly, or qualify that he is talking about specific objects (again, akin the definite article).</p>\\n\\n<p>For me, as a native speaker, it is not readily intuitive, but I do agree that author is onto something.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Old Russian dual and its relics in modern Russian</h2>\\n\\n<p>To shed more light on what the author talked about, below are several examples of Old Russian dual and its relics that remained after its extinction:</p>\\n\\n<p>The modern word <em>рука</em> (NOM SG F) meaning “arm” is the same in Old Russian save for the digraph <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uk_%28Cyrillic%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>ѹ</em></a> in place of <em>у</em> (both have similar or identical sound). NOM PL is the <em>рѹкы</em> (modern <em>руки</em>), and NOM-ACC-VOC DU is <em>рѹцѣ</em> which has no modern counterpart (although the numeral “two” follows the same paradigm for the F: modern <em>две</em> was <em>дъвѣ</em>). If that points to anything, this form is the same for DAT SG and LOC SG.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, in modern Russian there is no dual, but there is, we could say, paucal form for plural of 1.5, 2, 3, and 4. In case of <em>рука</em> and several other words it is formed with the same word as uncounted plural, but with the stress shift. “Two hands” is <em>две руки́</em>, but uncountable “hands” is <em>ру́ки</em>. From 5 to 20 GEN PL form is used: <em>13 рук</em>. After that combined numerals begin.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Question</h2>\\n\\n<p>From the article it is unclear to me what author means exactly by “connected dual”. As he writes “connected dual that combines the noun with the numeral ‘two’”, does it not defeat the whole idea of dual? Although examples of Old Russian dual <sup>(<a href=\"http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE#.D0.9F.D1.80.D0.B8.D0.BC.D0.B5.D1.80.D1.8B_.D1.83.D0.BF.D0.BE.D1.82.D1.80.D0.B5.D0.B1.D0.BB.D0.B5.D0.BD.D0.B8.D1.8F_.D0.B4.D0.B2.D0.BE.D0.B9.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B2.D0.B5.D0.BD.D0.BD.D0.BE.D0.B3.D0.BE_.D1.87.D0.B8.D1.81.D0.BB.D0.B0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rus</a>, Wikipedia)</sup> show that it could have been used both with or without numeral “two”. Gasparov also notes that after usage of dual had broadened, dual for paired objects took on function similar to that of definite article in English: <em>рѹцѣ</em> [dual, the arms, both arms, arms of one person] vs. <em>рѹкы</em> [plural, arms].</p>\\n\\n<p>What are the correct linguistic terms for these particular types?

I will try to describe:</p>\\n\\n<p>There are different types of writing systems, such as logographic, true alphabets and segmental scripts. Not sure if this is the cause of it, but my issue is that I noted that certain alphabet types, such as the \"featural linear alphabet\" used by e.g. Korean leads to words/characters being reused extensively with different meanings. Take for example 치다 which has <a href=\"http://dic.daum.net/word/view.do?wordid=kew000073484&amp;q=%EC%B9%98%EB%8B%A4&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">the meaning of \"strike, hit, beat\", but also many many other meanings</a>. It is one of the most frequent used words (at position 366 of circa 6000). On the other hand, those words in English (a Latin alphabet language) are often very distinct, but they were counted to be only at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_lists_by_frequency#English\" rel=\"nofollow\">30,000 (?) words</a>. At the same time, there are ~200.000 words though in Korean?</p>\\n\\n<p>I assume these effects may be similarly present in Chinese and Japanese, although my knowledge of those languages is limited. My question is now:</p>\\n\\n<p>How is the effect called in the Linguistics, in which a word has either (as in English) only a few (usually one) meanings vs. routinely having multiple meanings (as in Korean)?</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '<p>First off, I was about asking this question on <a href=\"https://german.stackexchange.com/\">German Language &amp; Usage</a> since this is a feature specific to the German language. Possibly, this feature exists in other languages as well but as far as I know not in English. Anyway, since this question is about linguistics I think this is the right place.</p>\\n<p>From what I know, transitivity, in linguistics, means whether or not a verb is followed by a direct object (called accusative in German). <em>To thank</em>, for example, is a transitive verb.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>*I thank.</p>\\n<p>I thank you.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In contrast, an intransitive verb must not take a direct object. <em>To die</em> is such a verb.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>*He died something.</p>\\n<p>He died.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><sub>(In addition, respective to comments: <em><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/die\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">To die</a></em> is defined as intransitive by Merriam-Webster dictionaries but it seems to be ambitransitive, too, because <em>to die a death</em> is valid transitive use of <em>to die</em>.)</sub></p>\\n<p>Some verbs can be followed by a direct object but this object is not necessary. These verbs are called ambitransitive. As example, consider the verb <em>to eat</em>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I am eating.</p>\\n<p>I ate an apple.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And some transitive verbs additionally have a second object, the indirect object (dative in German). The appropriate term is ditransitive.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>*I give.</p>\\n<p>*I give you.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll give you a chance.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll explain it to you.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Since the indirect object is the recipient of the direct object the indirect object can\\'t be defined independently from an direct object, at least in English.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>*I give to you.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In German, however, you can put a dative object behind some intransitive verbs. <em>Danken</em> (English <em>to thank</em>) is one of those verbs.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Ich danke dir.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In comparison to <em>I thank you</em>, <em>dir</em> is not an accusative in German and consequently not a direct object. I\\'d claim that in German it is possible to use an indirect object without a direct object.</p>\\n<p>To cut a long story short: what is the appropriate term for intransitive verbs which take an indirect object or dative, respectively, though?</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Regarding comments:<br />\\nI don\\'t understand the discussion about the definition of transitivity. In the German sentence <em>Ich danke dir</em> the verb <em>danken</em> is intransitive. I think Dixon\\'s definition is not relevant to this question. Of course, if it were <em>the definition par excellence</em> then <em>danken</em> would be transitive but before posting this question my research gave no inkling that I had to doubt whether <em>danken</em> is <em>intransitive</em> since it has no accusative object and that\\'s the <em>most accepted</em> definition.<br />\\n(Perhaps some linguistics will disagree. I\\'m not very familiar with linguistics but there\\'s one rule I follow in general: If even experts don\\'t agree then I stay with the most accepted definition until someone gives a persuasive counterargument.)<br />\\nThat said, sources that handles the German language only, and therefore using the terms accusative and dative object rather than direct and indirect object, mentions that a verb in its transitive form has to be followed by an accusative object.</p>\\n<p>That said, in the sentence above <em>danken</em> is intransitive. @jlawler confirms this when saying &quot;Transitivity is not a property of verbs per se, but of verbs in a particular sentence -- or perhaps, better, only of sentences&quot; although I think he actually wanted to say the opposite.</p>\\n<p>So, these discussion might be interesting but are unrelated to my question:  what are verbs called that are intransitive and followed by an dative object as <em>danken</em> in <em>Ich danke dir.</em></p>\\n',\n",

The amount of these users and their “stubbornness” finally become so high that it prevents changes of spelling from reaching broad acceptance, unless accepted and propagated by a central regulation body for the language. This particularly applies for changes of a more general nature that affect more than just a small number of words, e.g., a hypothetical replacement of c by\\xa0k, whenever it is pronounced as /k/ (as in <em>can),</em> for the English language.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two examples that stimulated my hypothesis:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>There is no central regulating body for the English language. As a result of this, there is some variety in spelling, e.g., the differences between British and American English or certain punctuation issues. However, the apart from this (and even within this), little to nothing has changed since the end of the 19th century (if I am not mistaken). Having read some of the works by H.P. Lovecraft, who is known for his archaic language, the only »old« spellings that caught my eye, were uses of the trema (e.g., in <em>coöperate)</em> and a few archaic vocables (e.g., <em>Esquimaux).</em></li>\\n<li>For the German language, the <em>Orthographische Konferenz</em> (Orthographical Conference) of 1901 established an official orthography and at the same time reformed some aspects of spelling, for which a widespread convention existed at that time, e.g. the usage of the letter\\xa0c. Though the next orthography reform (which most prominently changed the usage of the letter\\xa0ß) happened not until 1996, the spelling of many words changed during this time, e.g., many alternative spellings allowed in 1901 came out of use (e.g, <em>Concern</em>), modern spellings were established (e.g., <em>Photo → Foto</em>) and even one rule changed (the triple-letter rule, which became increasingly bizarre) – all this being done by the Duden dictionary, which had an official monopoly on defining correct spelling. While both reforms met heavy opposition, their changes became accepted very quickly (in about 10\\xa0years) by most users.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Finally, my question:\\nIs there more to my hypothesis (given a certain establishment of orthography, central regulating bodies accelerate orthography changes) than the above two examples?</p>\\n',\n",

The courses will be on syntax, semantics and phonetics/phonology. Below, I am providing brief descriptions of the courses:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Syntactic Analysis</strong>: <em>This course is an introduction to basic goals and methods of current syntactic theory through a detailed analysis of a range of phenomena, with emphasis on argumentation and empirical justification. Major topics include phrase structure and constituency, selection and subcategorization, argument structure, case, voice, expletives, and raising and control structures.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Semantics and Pragmatics</strong>: <em>This is the first in a two-course sequence designed to provide a foundation in the scientific study of all aspects of linguistic meaning. The first quarter focuses primarily on pragmatics:  those aspects of meaning that arise from the way that speakers put language to use, rather than through the formal properties of the linguistic system itself, which is the domain of semantics. However, a central goal of the course will be to begin to develop an understanding of the relation between pragmatics and semantics, by exploring empirical phenomena in which contextual and conventional aspects of meaning interact in complex but regular and well-defined ways, and by learning analytical techniques that allow us to tease these two aspects of linguistics meaning apart.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Phonological Analysis</strong>: <em>This course introduces cross-linguistic phonological phenomena and methods of analysis through an in-depth examination of fundamental notions that transcend differences between theoretical approaches: contrast, neutralization, natural classes, distinctive features, and basic non-linear phonological processes (e.g., assimilation, harmony, dissimilation).</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I would be most grateful if you could suggest textbooks (and, more generally, resources&nbsp;— including, but not limited to, lecture notes, websites, software) that would help me get a good grasp of this material.

None of these websites seems to offer any citations in support of this claim.

Some claim that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto#Language_teaching_introductory_effect\">Esperanto helps learners become aware of the essential characteristics of language</a> which allows them to focus on their target language more clearly.

As to be expected, each language has developed their own logographic simplifications as well as they differ in their pronunciation of various characters.</p>\\n\\n<p>I cannot speak for Japanese, but Korean\\'s pronunciations <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja#Pronunciation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seem to be related to the Chinese pronunciations of some older form of Chinese</a> but both languages have undergone sound changes meaning the differences are sometimes non-trivial.</p>\\n\\n<p>I have noticed (and previously described <a href=\"https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/3027/why-do-we-call-some-countries-a-different-name-than-the-people-of-that-country/3028#3028\">here</a>) that some Korean words, mostly proper nouns, can only be explained if they are translated literally from their written form, like some special form of a calque.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, the Korean word for \"USA\", <code>미국</code> (<em>mikuk</em>), is <a href=\"http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=14684900\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">derived from the Hanja <code>美國</code></a>. These are the same characters Mandarin uses for \"USA\". <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This etymology for the Mandarin <code>美國</code></a> (<em>měiguó</em>) shows that it must have originated in Mandarin (or some form of Chinese) before being adopted into Korean:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>America -> 亞美利加 (<em>yàměilìjiā</em>) -> 美國 (<em>měiguó</em>)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>(I\\'ve heard arguments that <code>미국</code> is actually derived from Chinese by way of Japanese, but this would not affect the phenomenon I am describing)</p>\\n\\n<p>If Koreans had adopted <code>美國</code> through a phonological process alone, one would expect something like <code>메궈</code> (<em>mekweo</em>). The Korean transliteration for \"America\" is <code>아메리카</code> (<em>amelikha</em>). As such, it\\'s hard to explain the presence of <code>미</code> (<em>mi</em>) through any type of phonological adoption alone.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, we can easily predict the appearance of <code>미</code> (<em>mi</em>) from the character <code>美</code> (literally meaning \"beauty\") which is consistently pronounced as <code>미</code> (<em>mi</em>) even in situations not referring to the USA. For example, <code>미용실</code> (<code>美容室</code>, <em>miyongsil</em>, a beauty parlour). Similarly, <code>國</code> is consistently pronounced <code>국</code> (<em>kuk</em>) even in situations not referring to the USA. For example, <code>국회</code> (<code>國會</code>, <em>kukhoy</em>, the National Assembly). This is why I feel that the Korean pronunciation <code>미국</code> (<em>mikuk</em>) had to be adopted from the Chinese written form, not spoken.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, there are alternatives. There is evidence that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja#Pronunciation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Korean sound change was more conservative</a> when it came to the pronunciation of Sino-Korean vocabulary than some Chinese dialects. It is entirely possible that the original pronunciation of <code>美國</code> was closer to <em>mikuk</em> even in Chinese before sound change resulted in modern Mandarin\\'s <em>meiguo</em>. Unfortunately I cannot rule this out as I do not know when <code>美國</code> entered the Chinese vocabulary but subjectively the <em>mei</em> in <em>meiguo</em> is a closer transliteration than the <em>mi</em> in <em>mikuk</em> and the difference in pronunciation can easily be explained by Hanja pronunciation rules (I am aware the subjective judgements are not evidence).</p>\\n\\n<p>A clearer example is the Korean word for \"Germany\", <code>독일</code> (<em>dokil</em>). This <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EB%8F%85%EC%9D%BC#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">was derived from the Japanese transliteration of \"Deutsche\"</a> (as in \"Deutschland\"), <code>ドイツ</code> (<em>doitsu</em>). If Koreans had transliterated it themselves we would expect to see <code>도이치</code> (<em>doichi</em>). Similarly, if Korean had adopted it from the Japanese through phonological methods alone we would expect either <code>도이치</code> again or possibly <code>도이즈</code> (<em>doiceu</em>), again making it hard to explain the Korean pronunciation through phonological means. However, like before we can easily explain the Korean pronunciation using Hanja character pronunciations:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Deutsche ->  ドイツ (<em>doitsu</em>, Katakana) -> 独逸 (Kanji) -> 獨逸 (Kyūjitai/Hanja) -> 독일 (<em>dokil</em>)  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Note that the Katakana, Kanji, and Kyūjitai forms are pronounced identically and I am not implying they are discrete steps in the derivation just that I include them as evidence for the relationship between <code>ドイツ</code> and <code>독일</code>. Also note that the Mandarin word for \"Germany\" uses unrelated characters and shows a different etymology.</p>\\n\\n<p>This phenomenon even applies to names of people:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Li\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">李连杰</a> (<em>lǐ liánjié</em>, Simplified Chinese) -> 李連杰 (Traditional Chinese/Hanja) -> <a href=\"http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9D%B4%EC%97%B0%EA%B1%B8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">이연걸</a> (<em>iyeonkeol</em>)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In summary, Korean has an internally consistent system for pronouncing Chinese characters (called Hanja in Korean). All Sino-Korean words have a written form using Hanja characters which can be found in any Korean dictionary (although non Sino-Korean words do not have Hanja forms). In some cases it is almost impossible to explain the Korean pronunciation of a borrowing though phonological processes alone but trivial if one considers the borrowing\\'s Hanja written form. This means that it\\'s the written form that affects the word\\'s pronunciation instead of the expected opposite.</p>\\n\\n<p>Is there a name for this type of phenomenon, specifically with respect to borrowings? Does this phenomenon occur in any language other than Korean? (I suspect it occurs in all languages which relied heavily on Chinese script at any point in their history, but I do not have any examples) Is this phenomenon unique to Chinese script due to its ideographic nature and other geopolitical factors?</p>\\n\\n<p>Is there any special term for a word\\'s written form causing its spoken form to be reevaluated (even language-internally)? I would appreciate any examples of such.</p>\\n',\n",

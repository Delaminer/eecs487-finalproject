As part of the revitalization process, we need to standardize an orthography for this language. However, we are not sure if we should represent phonemes or phones in the orthography. For instance, in cases where two consecutive /k/ phonemes occur as in /kk/, the pronunciation in Nawat actually entails aspiration of the first k, resulting in [hk]. Consequently, a word like /nutsakka/ is articulated as [nutsahka], should we write it as nutzakka or nutzahka? Similarly, when /n/ precedes /p/, as in /senpa/, the articulation in Nawat is [sempa]. Should we write senpa or sempa in such instances?</p>\n<p>In the context of revitalizing endangered languages that have primarily been oral, should orthographies represent phonemes or phones? How do we address the issue of phonemic vs. phonetic orthographical representation in cases where there are differences in pronunciation such as the example of /kk/ becoming [hk] in Salvadoran Nawat?</p>\n"

But I cannot find a case where this or a related form would mean &quot;treasure&quot;, on the model of the Latin <em>thesaurus</em> and Greek <em>\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2</em>, with this basic semantic coincidence or transfer between content (treasure) and recipient (treasury, box, strongbox).</p>\n<p>I was thus very surprised watching <a href=\"https://italian.stackexchange.com/q/14262/5860\">an Italian movie where a seemingly  slang or invented word in the <em>romanesco</em> dialect means &quot;strongbox&quot; but sounds close to Romanian <em>comoar\u0103</em></a>. All that leads nowhere though, as it seems.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I am still intrigued: <em><strong>is the Romanian word the only member of that group of words in Eastern Europe which means &quot;treasure&quot;?</strong></em> ---no matter the ultimate supposedly Latin origin of all of them - from <em>camera</em>---</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is to be noted that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>the word <em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kamera#Etymology_8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kamera</a></em> (Romanian <em>camera</em>) present in many Slavic languages, including Russian, has to be considerd separately, as a neologism equivalent to the Italian word <em>camera</em> - usually including the somewhat \u201dmodern\u201d meanings of \u201droom\u201d (sometimes in a technical sense), \u201dlegislative body\u201d and \u201dphotographic camera\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Bulgarian <em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0#Bulgarian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kamara</a></em> seems to be not one word, but three different words, although similar in form: one, pronounced <code>'kam\u0259r\u0259</code>, means \u201clegislative body\u201d and is of Turkish origin; a second one is an archaism, has the same pronunciation, means \u201cchamber, vaulted room\u201d and is of Slavic origin; <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0#Etymology_3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a third one</a> is pronounced <code>k\u0250\u02c8mar\u0259</code>, means \u201cpile, heap\u201d , \u201da load\u201d, \u201da ton of\u201d something, and supposedly is of Greek origin. This might be the only case that looks close to the Romanian one: that transfer from generic-Slavic \u201dchamber\u201d (<em>camera</em>/<em>komora</em>) to  \u201da pile of stuff\u201d (<em>kamara</em>-'kam\u0259r\u0259`) seems <em>based</em> on (mediated by) Romanian \u201dpile of gold\u201d (<em>comoar\u0103</em>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>I will maybe ask separate questions, but if you can help, please answer this here too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>how solid is the Latin etymology for <em>komora</em> in Polish, Czech, Macedonian etc?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>are these forms recent neologisms (like <em>kamera</em> is), relative old neologisms, or old Slavic forms (even if ultimately from Latin)?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>couldn't there be a direct Proto-Slavic &lt; <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/kh%E2%82%82em\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PIE origin</a>?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

I thought this was a ludicrous idea, but his example sentences <em>were</em> funny, and when me and my friends made up new ones by selecting random words, they were still funny. I wouldn't ever have thought something like this was possible, except I swear this was part of the lecture.</p>\n<p>Note the sentences that it produces don't make sense.

            "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKGoVefhtMQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This old CollegeHumor sketch</a> highlights an interesting phenomenon: it's often frowned upon or disapproved of, at least in the US and England, to pronounce a loanword according to the phonetics of the language it was borrowed from. For example, anecdotally in the UK, an English speaker would probably think it strange if I pronounced &quot;karaoke&quot; according to the Japanese \u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1 pronunciation, as opposed to the pronunciation common in the US/UK: /\u02cck\u00e6ri\u02c8o\u028aki/.</p>\n<p>I think that in this case, this is because the different phonetics of the Japanese word make the &quot;native&quot; pronunciation jarring in the middle of a sentence. Having to modify the intonation to match Japanese pitch-accent for example, and using sounds such as the alveolar flap in \u30e9 which aren't found in English, would probably not be what the listener was expecting to hear unless the conversation was about the Japanese language or pronunciation. So using the &quot;native&quot; pronunciation might be frowned upon/disapproved of simply because it is unexpected in the linguistic context.</p>\n<p>The &quot;point&quot; that the video makes is that doing this is considered &quot;over-pronouncing&quot;, and is considered either funny or embarrassing in contexts of two or more native speakers of a language (such as English) where one of them &quot;over-pronounces&quot; a loanword from another language. Presumably again it would not be frowned upon if (e.g.) English speakers were talking to Japanese natives about &quot;karaoke&quot; and used the Japanese pronunciation.</p>\n<p>So my question is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the disapproval towards approximating foreign loanword pronunciations occur at all outside of the context of English speakers using a non-English loanword?</li>\n<li>If so, is it common to disapprove of foreign loanword pronunciations? Or conversely, is it common in many other parts of the world to emulate foreign loanword pronunciations to the best of the speaker's ability?</li>\n</ul>\n"

            "body": "<p>in the following sentence:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;Teraz id\u0119 do \u017cabki po sok&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>What is the function of the genitive case applied on the noun &quot;\u017cabka&quot;?</p>\n<p>I'm aware that with the preposition &quot;do&quot;, especially regarding a location, the genitive case is used to decline the following nouns. And I'm aware that verbs and prepositions go with specific cases.</p>\n<p>But can someone explain the grammatical function of the genitive in this sentence, and the grammatical reasoning behind why it's this case and not another that is used?</p>\n<p>I would appreciate a thorough, detailed explanation. If you happen to be a grammar nerd, I sincerely encourage you to answer, your response will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"

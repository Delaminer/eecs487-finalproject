"What does Maugham mean by ""his spaghetti were""?","
Possible Duplicate:
Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common? 

[Following up from, but not a duplicate of, this question by another user, which was unresolved…]
Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence contains an unusual (perhaps even unique) usage of English that I'm hoping some native speaker can shed light on. Here is the sentence in bold, with some surrounding sentences for context. Dirk Stroeve has previously been described as ""a painter, but a very bad one"". The narrator says:

In the evenings I went to see my
  friends.  I looked in often on the
  Stroeves, and sometimes shared their
  modest fare.  Dirk Stroeve flattered
  himself on his skill in cooking
  Italian dishes, and I confess that
  his spaghetti were very much
  better than his pictures.  It was a
  dinner for a King when he brought in a
  huge dish of it, succulent with
  tomatoes, and we ate it together with
  the good household bread and a bottle
  of red wine.  I grew more intimate
  with Blanche Stroeve…

Since spaghetti is (almost?) always used in English in the singular as an uncountable (mass) noun, this is unusual. What is the right interpretation of this sentence?

""His spaghetti"" is parallel to ""his omelettes"". That is, it refers to the many occasions he cooked spaghetti, and means something like ""his spaghetti dishes were better than his pictures"". (The OED entry for 'spaghetti' has ""1. a. A variety of pasta made in long thin strings. Occas., a dish of spaghetti."")
As in the original Italian usage, ""spaghetti"" in the plural here refers to multiple strands of spaghetti or pieces of spaghetti.
Something else.

(I am partial to (1.) myself, but this interpretation was described by another user as ""unlikely"" and ""completely absurd"", so I'm trying to know for sure.)
",861,"Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common?","In W. Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence, there is a line about Dirk Stroeve which goes His spaghetti were ….

cannot => can't

In these examples, the o sound in not is dropped and the letter o (no in the case of cannot) is replaced with an apostrophe.

Not once, but twice. As far as I could tell it was not being used tongue in cheek. In the Feb '10 issue, in the article about the Congo Chimps.

Pluralizing keywords in programming languages,"
Possible Duplicate:
Marking plural of code words 

In the language that I'm currently working in one of the keywords is try. I'm writing an error message:

No implementation for global level try statements.

It's too long in my source and so I would very much like to reduce it to

No implementation for global level try's. 

Anybody using my code should understand it very easily as my code is entirely about dynamically determining what exception handling is in place and the try keyword is one of the cornerstones of exception handling in the given language.

Could we pretend for the duration that I'm not being overly picky?
Is this pluralization correct or at least acceptable? Both ""tries"" and ""trys"" look very wrong to me. 
Are there general rules pertaining to pluralizing keywords and other identifiers from programming languages. A quick google search and more extensive search of this site didn't quite do it. I did find this question. The selected answer assumes the presence of markup (not available in my case) and the other answer sidesteps the issue by avoiding pluralizing the words in question. Are there any new insights to be had?  

An answer to (3) would answer (2) of course and so I would be happy with just that. If it's not available though, I would appeciate input on (2). 
",6067,Marking plural of code words,"In my blog (which is about programming) I often use reserved words from different programming languages.
Like this:

When column is nullable in both tables, this query won't return a match of two NULLs for the reasons described above: no NULLs are equal.

Here, NULL is a programming language keyword.
For numerous reasons, I mark them with <code> tag so they are rendered with a fixed width font, not translated into the foreign languages by Google Translate, can easily be seen on the page etc.
In the example above, which would be the best way to mark the plural?

NULLs
NULL s
NULL's
NULLs
NULLS

Option 1 looks ugly on the page (the word and the plural marker are rendered in different colors and fonts)
Option 2 adds a space between the word and the plural marker
Option 3 looks nicest but is not correct
Options 4 and 5 may leave the reader under impression that NULLS is a reserved word (which is not true) and this may be confusing. Also, Google Translate would leave the word as is which would be definitely wrong in other languages.

When is it okay to end a sentence in a preposition?

So we've all heard the admonishments from our teachers not to end a clause with a preposition

A plumber visits a wealthy estate to fix a clogged toilet. As the butler opens the door, the plumber barks out,""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at?""
""Please try to speak with more discretion. We do not want to disturb our neighbors with the details of our plumbing issues. And we most certainly do not end our sentences with prepositions, sir.
So the plumber lowers his tone and says more cordially, ""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at, asshole.""

Anyway, back to the matter at hand. I have come under the impression that this is a rule of thumb to help the elementary student avoid mismatching case for the target of the preposition rather than a hard rule. For example by placing the preposition closer to its target, you avoid constructs like: ""Who did you give the invitation to?"" instead of the proper ""To whom did you give the invitation?"". Moving the preposition closer makes the incorrect case sound absurd. No one would ever say ""To who did you give the invitation?""

(NOAD = New Oxford American Dictionary)
One, Is this categorization valid? That is, is it correct to say, as the NOAD does, that these words are indeed plural (but treated as singular), rather than to say that they are singular? The accepted answer on that question, by user RegDwigнt, has a different analysis that speaks in terms of “news” being ""uncountable"", ""used with singular verbs"", and ""etymologically, it used to be a plural form"", and thereby carefully avoids addressing this issue, of whether these nouns are indeed plural-treated-as-singular. So my question remains.
Two, If so, what makes these words plural? Is it the fact that they end in s? (Surely ""bus"" is not plural?) Is it history? (Were they used as plural at some time? How far back in history does one go to decide whether a noun is singular or plural?) Is it the fact that they don't have any distinct forms treated as plural?
Most importantly, why do we even have a grammatical category of ""plural nouns treated as singular""? What purpose does it serve, and how are such nouns functionally distinguishable from nouns that are actually singular? When/if the reason is history, is there a rationale for saying ""plural nouns treated as singular"" rather than ""singular nouns that were formerly plural""?
Edit: My question isn't just about ""-ics"" words, but all words in the category ""plural nouns treated as singular"" (assuming that the category isn't just -ics words).
Edit 2: The image and part ""One"" of the question were added later; previously I took for granted that the categorization was valid.

Using 'they' for person of unknown sex,"

Sally: I don't know. They didn't say.

“Whereäs” as an alternative spelling of “whereas” 

I've got an impression that there is (or was) a rule in English: 
If you have a rarely used word with two vowel letters in a row, corresponding to two vowel sounds in a row (as opposed to a diphthong or single vowel sound marked by two letters), you have to mark a second vowel with a trema.
For example: coöperation.
As rarely used word gets more popular and recognizable, trema is dropped from the spelling. In contemporary English cooperation is spelled without it.
Is there an authoritative source on this rule?
I guess, any linguistics work would do, Wikipedia would not. Something that I can cite and not be laughed at.
",16959,"""Whereäs"" as an alternative spelling of ""whereas""","Wiktionary shows whereäs as a valid alternative spelling of the word whereas (see here).

It has long been my impression that 'shall', 'will', and 'must' have about the same imperative weight; that is, the phrase that follows these words is a command that is not to be questioned.  However, in my mind, 'should' falls in a category of lighter imperativeness, almost to the same level as 'may'; that is, the phrase that follows 'should' is a command that does not need to be completed.

Recommendation for English Grammar books?,"
Possible Duplicate:
What are some of the better English reference grammars? 

I grew up in a non-English speaking country. During my elementary and middle school years, I self-studied the grammar of English via various books written by the most famous experts in my country, although these were beyond what were required by my curriculum. I am not saying my English is good enough now, but the study from the old days still helps me a lot for my life in U.S. later.
After coming to U.S., I have often got my mind boggled by various usages of English either in talks or in prints, which seem to be inconsistent with what I have learned before. In my guess, the reasons can be a combination of any of the following: 

what I have learned is probably
based on British English;
the usage by American is not always
rigorous, which sometimes put me
into the dilemma of which to follow;
I might need some excellent English
grammar books whose authors are
trustworthy experts who are also
native English speaker.

So, my question is, as for my last point, what are your recommendations for English grammar books? I would like to read comprehensive and nice-organized books from being concise, to being detailed. I think books for middle and elementary schools are perhaps not what I am looking for.

This question is a little hard to summarize in the title.
I sometimes like to use parentheses to add additional (but nonessential) details to a sentence - like I did just there. My criteria for such use is usually that the sentence could be read with the text in the parentheses, or excluding the text, and each would be an equally valid and grammatically correct statement.
So I am curious: in a case where the parenthesis is preceded by the word 'a', and the word in parenthesis begins with a vowel (or unsounded h) that would require it to be changed to 'an', what is the correct statement?

I'm just trying to slip the word in there to cover my ass if someone says ""That's not a valid reference - it's just an anectote.""

(highlighting/ellipsis added by me)
(NOAD = New Oxford American Dictionary)
One, Is this categorization valid? That is, is it correct to say, as the NOAD does, that these words are indeed plural (but treated as singular), rather than to say that they are singular? The accepted answer on that question, by user RegDwigнt, has a different analysis that speaks in terms of “news” being ""uncountable"", ""used with singular verbs"", and ""etymologically, it used to be a plural form"", and thereby carefully avoids addressing this issue, of whether these nouns are indeed plural-treated-as-singular. So my question remains.
Two, If so, what makes these words plural? Is it the fact that they end in s? (Surely ""bus"" is not plural?) Is it history? (Were they used as plural at some time? How far back in history does one go to decide whether a noun is singular or plural?) Is it the fact that they don't have any distinct forms treated as plural?
Most importantly, why do we even have a grammatical category of ""plural nouns treated as singular""? What purpose does it serve, and how are such nouns functionally distinguishable from nouns that are actually singular? When/if the reason is history, is there a rationale for saying ""plural nouns treated as singular"" rather than ""singular nouns that were formerly plural""?
Edit: My question isn't just about ""-ics"" words, but all words in the category ""plural nouns treated as singular"" (assuming that the category isn't just -ics words).
Edit 2: The image and part ""One"" of the question were added later; previously I took for granted that the categorization was valid.

"Use of ""I"", ""we"" and the passive voice in a scientific thesis","
Possible Duplicate:
Style Question: Use of “we” vs. “I” vs. passive voice in a dissertation 

When the first person voice is used in scientific writing it is mostly used in the first person plural, as scientific papers almost always have more than one co-author, such as

We propose a new method to study cell differentiation in nematodes.

Often the ""we"" also includes the reader

We may see in Figure 4.2 that...

However, I am writing a thesis which means I am the only author and I even have to testify in writing that the work is my own and I did not receive any help other than from the indicated sources. Therefore it seems I should use ""I"", but this seems to be very unusual in scientific writing and even discouraged as one may sound pretentious or self-absorbed. However, the alternative is to use the passive voice, which seems to be even more discouraged as it produces hard to read writing and indeed an entire thesis in the passive voice may be indigestible for any reader.
So far, I used the second form of ""we"" extensively that includes me and the reader. This form is often natural when describing mathematical derivations as the truth is objective and it suggests that I am taking the reader by the hand and walking her through the process. Still, I'm trying not do overdo this form. 
However, eventually I will need to refer to methods that I propose and choices that I have made. Should I just follow scientific convention and use ""we"" although it is factually inaccurate or indeed write in the scorned-upon ""I""?
",24629,"Style Question: Use of ""we"" vs. ""I"" vs. passive voice in a dissertation","As I'm not a native speaker and just finishing my dissertation in Computer Science, I wonder  what style I should be using.

In most of my publications I use ""we"" (e.g. ""we can improve the recognition rate by ..."").
For the dissertation, as it is my work, should I prefer ""I"" over ""we""? I don't like the idea too much, as it sounds pretentious to me.

Possible Duplicate:
Gender neutral pronoun 

Very often, I find myself writing about a user, an anonymous person whose gender I don't know.
Right after mentioning this abstract user, I need to make a reference to the said person, and I often end up using he/she, as a shorter version of he or she.
Example:

Note that the user may get confused by
  the fact that green button turns red
  when he/she presses the blue button.

And then I need to make another reference in another sentence right after that, and I find it heavy to write he/she again... So I write he.
I am confused by this because in French, every single noun has a gender. We don't have any neuter. Utilisateur, which means user in French, is masculine. Whereas personne is feminine.
So I don't have this problem in French. If I talk about a user then I can say he. If I talk about a person, I say she. 
But how to deal properly and elegantly with this situation in English?

It seems weird because you would never use ""I's"" on its own but it is not on its own here - it is part of a noun phrase.

That's a rather intriguing argument. Does it hold any water?

When to use the feminine form when referring to a person?,"

Tendency of using pronouns 'she/her' when talking about a random person 

I was never interested in grammar and English in school.  Now that I am older, I am finding it was more important than I gave it credit.  Especially with the people I deal with at work.
Plus, I am finding an interest for it now.
Anyway, I've noticed over the years that when referring to a person, most books and articles tend to use the feminine form.
For example:
""A good programmer knows she should write tests.""
Instead of using ""he/she"" they prefer to use ""she"".  Same is true for ""her"" instead of ""his/her"".
Where did this come from?  I'm not complaining, I actually prefer it.  Reminds me of a ""ladies first"" mentality.  But am I correct in assuming it is grammatically (or maybe politically) correct to use this form?
Thanks

Possible Duplicate:
What is the origin of ZOMG? 

What ever does ZOMG mean? And where did it come from?
",26142,What is the origin of ZOMG?,"I have looked in a number of places, with contradictory results.
The Urban Dictionary provides a whopping 73 ""explanations"", of which I will quote just a few. (Original spelling and punctuation preserved.)


ZOMG is a variant of the all-too-popular acronym ""OMG"", meaning ""Oh My God"".
  ZOMG originated from the image-board 4chan.org and one of it's members Zardoz.


Even though 4chan is the Internet meme machine, I would like to see supporting
evidence for this particular claim.


zOMG is a variant of the all-too-popular acronym ""OMG"", meaning ""Oh My God"". The ""z"" was originally a mistake while attempting to hit the shift key with the left hand, and type ""OMG""


The first sentence is copied verbatim from the previous (and older) explanation,
with the ""Z"" changed into a ""z"". It appears that the author hasn't quite thought
it through — if you mistakenly hit Z instead of Shift, you'll end up with ""zomg"", not with ""zOMG"". Besides, on my keyboard, there's the > key between the Z and the left shift key.


A more enthusiastic (if not sarcastic) way of saying OMG. The Z doesn't stand for anything, but rather is added onto the O, thus making it pronounced ""ZOH MY GOD!!1""


Doesn't address the origin and is not very convincing anyway — why ""Z"" and not ""S"", ""X"", ""W"", ""J"", or in fact any letter?


ZOMG was the ruler of the planet XYRZON until 2451 AD, when he was overthrown
  by KFOP after the battle of SHMUR.


Oh well.


zombies! oh my god!


This is actually the most convincing so far, since over at the Wiktionary I am told that ZOMG is an initialism. Then again, I am not told anything about etymology, and in the usage notes for OMG, I am told that ZOMG is ""emphatic, in the same sense of LOLZ"". Which contradicts the idea that it's an initialism.
On the talk page for ZOMG, there's only this brief exchange:

This entry should be amended to note that the ""z"" is added emphasis from the common
  typo committed when hitting the ""shift"" key. [Unsigned, but the history attributes this to
  Adjwilli, 19:50, 4 November 2008]

Except that it's not: see [1].
  Unfortunately, although this FAQ is accurate, the fact that it has not been cited in
  a reliable source means that we cannot include it on Wiktionary. Shii 14:21, 12 December 2008 (UTC)


That last link is dead, so I went to archive.org and dug up an old copy of the page:

ZOMG was originally coined in January 2003 by two individuals, James Curbo and Matthew Milan, over ICQ
The following chat log may or may not be exact, so apocraphycal information has been used to recreate this event.
Hannibal Smith:  d00der!
  Rick Feynman:  zomg!
  Hannibal Smith:  ZOMG!
  Rick Feynman:  fag! ZOMG!

I can see why reliable sources are hesitant to cite this FAQ, especially given the fact that it was written by Matthew Milan himself.
Lastly, over at The Free Dictionary, I am told that ZOMG is an acronym with the
following definitions:


Zoh My God! (gaming, World of Warcraft)
Zombies Oh My God
Zeus, Oh My God
Zerg! Oh My God!
Zebras on my Grass (gaming clan)


Now I am utterly confused. Some of these suspiciously look like backronyms.
So, can anyone, by any chance, provide a definite answer on the origin of ZOMG? Or is it lost forever?

I am faster than 15 miles per hour. – To me this is clearly incorrect. Directly comparing me to a speed doesn't seem right. We need to compare my speed to a speed, or me to another person.

I can run faster than him. – Compared to the base sentence, there is a distinct shift in meaning of the comparison. While before I named a speed faster than which I can run, now I am naming a person. It doesn't seem quite right. I realize the parts of speech can change, but my initial objection is that ""him"" is not a speed.

I can run faster than he. – This seems most correct to me, but still somehow feels objectionable. Is this in fact the correct way to say it? And if so, is it proper as is or need I say ""... faster than he can"" or even ""... faster than he can run?""

I am faster than him. – With ""am"" instead of ""can run"" it now seems slightly more correct. But is it?

I am faster than he. – I'm in doubt here. It doesn't seem wrong to me to say, ""I am faster than he is"" or even ""I am faster than he is fast."" (Though I suppose that is a given since I could hardly properly compare to some other category as in ""I am faster than he is smart."")

The answer in Rooth (1992), Fiengo and May (1994), Chung et al.

I feel that using the singular noun to specify the class is more grammatically correct, but sounds stilted in conversation. Almost everyone I hear making these constructions uses the plural form. What are your thoughts about singular vs. plural here?
Edit
Here's a more extreme example that may help clarify the issue. Consider the following sentence:

It was my first attempt at calming an angry crowd, and I just 
      stood there while people were hurling all kinds of insults at me.

Here I think the singular insult sounds strange, if not downright wrong.
Further Edit
I just noticed in A Treasury for Word Lovers (Morton S. Freeman, 1983) a section entitled ""Types of Errors."" This is a book about (American) English usage by an English professor and editor, which purports to be a ""practical guide for serious writers and readers."" I wish I could say this discovery satisfies the question, but in fact I now feel somewhat farther from the truth, if there is any single ""truth"" in this matter. But at least I don't have to worry about being wrong when using the plural form of the class in these constructions.

"What does Maugham mean by ""his spaghetti were""?","
Possible Duplicate:
Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common? 

[Following up from, but not a duplicate of, this question by another user, which was unresolved…]
Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence contains an unusual (perhaps even unique) usage of English that I'm hoping some native speaker can shed light on. Here is the sentence in bold, with some surrounding sentences for context. Dirk Stroeve has previously been described as ""a painter, but a very bad one"". The narrator says:

In the evenings I went to see my
  friends.  I looked in often on the
  Stroeves, and sometimes shared their
  modest fare.  Dirk Stroeve flattered
  himself on his skill in cooking
  Italian dishes, and I confess that
  his spaghetti were very much
  better than his pictures.  It was a
  dinner for a King when he brought in a
  huge dish of it, succulent with
  tomatoes, and we ate it together with
  the good household bread and a bottle
  of red wine.  I grew more intimate
  with Blanche Stroeve…

Since spaghetti is (almost?) always used in English in the singular as an uncountable (mass) noun, this is unusual. What is the right interpretation of this sentence?

""His spaghetti"" is parallel to ""his omelettes"". That is, it refers to the many occasions he cooked spaghetti, and means something like ""his spaghetti dishes were better than his pictures"". (The OED entry for 'spaghetti' has ""1. a. A variety of pasta made in long thin strings. Occas., a dish of spaghetti."")
As in the original Italian usage, ""spaghetti"" in the plural here refers to multiple strands of spaghetti or pieces of spaghetti.

I am writing in England and am 66 years old - the word 'fanny' in my era is slang for the most intimate part of a woman's body, yet means other things in other versions of English, and is indeed used as a woman's nickname in England on some occasions. So what I am after is something about renaming akin to a nickname - I had hoped it will come back to me but it has not yet!
All this was prompted by the sight of a product supplied in a can - I am not sure where from - that contains what I know as tuna fish but is called 'Fanny' and therefore if it were seen in a British provision store might produce a smirk or embarrassed giggles because some, such as me, would consider it rude - I have said too much.
My wife could not help, she compared it to 'Betty' as an alternative to Elizabeth - but I do not think that is quite the same - as Betty - to me seems - a definite abbreviation of Elizabeth.

However, I am asking this question because I implicitly learned from usage (as a non-native speaker) only the first meaning, while a friend (also a non-native speaker) insists that only the second meaning is correct. Since the definitions I can find are somewhat vague, like the above ones (e.g. they are compatible with the idea that nutritious can even refer to things like sleep, which ""promotes or sustains life,…"", which is, as far as I know, not the case), I can't know for sure which, or if both the interpretations above are implied by ""nutritious"".

In these examples, the o sound in not is dropped and the letter o (no in the case of cannot) is replaced with an apostrophe.

to be “stuck up” on a problem / in traffic (source)
to “reply back” to a message (source (#5))
to be “called as” a name (source (#8))
to “emphasize on” an item (source (#13))
to “order for” a pizza / sandwich (source (#28))

Etymonline says ought has been detached from owe since 17c. and provides the etymology of ought as below:

Old English ahte ""owned, possessed,"" past tense of agan ""to own, possess; owe"" (see owe). As a past tense of owe, it shared in that word's evolution and meant at times in Middle English ""possessed"" and ""under obligation to pay."" It has been detached from owe since 17c., though he aught me ten pounds is recorded as active in East Anglian dialect c. 1825. As an auxiliary verb expressing duty or moral obligation (the main modern use, attested from late 12c.), it represents the past subjunctive.

Ought, Should. Ought is the stronger, expressing especially obligations of duty, with some weaker use in expressing interest or necessity: as, you ought to know, if any one does. Should sometimes expresses duty: as, we should be careful of others' feelings; but generally expresses propriety, expediency, etc.: as, we should dot our i's and cross our t's.

As a non-native English speaker, this sounds wrong to me. I interpret it as a parody of someone not very familiar with technology, but I'm not sure my intuitions are accurate.
I certainly see how a tech-literate person would say ""I used the calendar"" for the iPhone app ""Calendar"", but with a less generic name like ""Tweetbot"" or ""Instapaper"", I get the impression they're aiming to be funny. Or that they were at one point aiming to be funny, and now they do it by rote, as with ""funny"" expressions like ""What can I do you for?""

",8198,Where a person has advantage in a specific scenario,"
Sally and Tom live in the same street and are both looking for love. Both Sally and Tom have average looking faces.
   Sally is a 37 year old overweight unemployed divorced stay-at-home mother of a 12 year old boy. Tom  is a fit single, childless, 32 year old with a stable job as a civil planner, enjoys the outdoors and is a runner. 
  Sally and Tom join Tinder at the same time. Both add a single photo of themselves and list their hobbies and family circumstances.  Both Sally and Tom decide to swipe right(like) every photo they see on their screens.
After both have done this for a thousand photos they only return to the app a week later. Sally has 200 mutual likes and message from men of various ages wanting to hook up. Tom has no mutual likes.

As a result Sally has a high expectation of her desirability and Tom forms a very low expectation of his desirability.
One could argue  people are biased for Sally/ biased against  Tom but in a real life scenario if Sally and Tom went independently to a club, Tom would get more  interest shown in him than Sally. So the word(s) I'm looking for is related to a specific scenario/use case i.e. Tinder but not in general.
If I look at words like bias, prejudice, discrimination ,inequity, favouritism it has the feeling of unfair which is not want I want to convey, but I rather want to say an illogical advantage not applicable to real life, just Tinder.
Since online dating sites like Tinder did not exist 20+ years ago the word I though of is
Zeitgeist

  the defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time.

However, I have been confused for a time to what the letters in the appellation refer to.  I have 3 hypotheses, in order of my confidence in them:

A man of letters is referred to as such because of the voluminous correspondence such a man would be expected to keep, as befitting a man acquainted with the leading literary and scientific figures of his day; we might expect the study room of a man of a letters to be replete with mail from all over the country, and much of his intellectual oeuvre might be completed within such letters.

The appellation to refers to the distinct British habit of abbreviating all sorts of personal and professional accomplishments with letters of the Latin Alphabet.   For example, an Alexander Trevelyan, BA, MA, Ph. D, FRS, KB might be appropriately described as a man of letters.
It refers to simply the sort the material that should fill such a man's life; books, pamphlets, tractates and so on.  The letters refer more to his literacy, than to his correspondence.

"Ending a clause with a preposition, rule of thumb or hard rule?","
Possible Duplicate:
When is it okay to end a sentence in a preposition?

So we've all heard the admonishments from our teachers not to end a clause with a preposition

A plumber visits a wealthy estate to fix a clogged toilet. As the butler opens the door, the plumber barks out,""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at?""
""Please try to speak with more discretion. We do not want to disturb our neighbors with the details of our plumbing issues. And we most certainly do not end our sentences with prepositions, sir.
So the plumber lowers his tone and says more cordially, ""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at, asshole.""

Anyway, back to the matter at hand. I have come under the impression that this is a rule of thumb to help the elementary student avoid mismatching case for the target of the preposition rather than a hard rule. For example by placing the preposition closer to its target, you avoid constructs like: ""Who did you give the invitation to?"" instead of the proper ""To whom did you give the invitation?"". Moving the preposition closer makes the incorrect case sound absurd. No one would ever say ""To who did you give the invitation?""
All of this introductory text leads up to this simple question: Is this phrase correct ""Whom did you give the invitation to?"" or is it still incorrect english even though we addressed the issue of case?

a vocal sound or set of sounds uttered with a single effort of articulation and forming a word or an element of a word; each of the elements of spoken language comprising a sound of greater sonority (vowel or vowel-equivalent) with or without one or more sounds of less sonority (consonants or consonant-equivalents).

If I say, ""I'll meet you at the church"" - church involves, for me, two 'efforts of articulation' ... two syllables?

When should I use “a” vs “an”?
“a” or “an” for words that don't start with vowels but sound like they're starting with a vowel 

On some forum today I referred to myself as a English nerd. Now I'm wondering whether maybe I'm an English nerd.
My gut feeling tells me that there is a slight nuance in meaning between the two phrases and that even though the general rule is to use an in front of a word starting with a vowel, I think a is more appropriate in this case.

",13735,"Do /ɪə/, /eə/, /ʊə/ diphthongs actually exist in General American as phonemes?","The Handbook of English Pronunciation. (Marnie Reed, John Levis referring to J.C. Wells) 

Аs the pronunciation of most speakers is rhotic, there are no centring
  diphthongs, because the vowels /ɪə, eə, ʊə/ in words such as peer,
  pair, and poor are a sequence of a monophthong followed by /r/ so the
  rhyme of these words is /ɪr/, /er/, and /ʊr/ respectively.

Acoustics of American English Speech: A Dynamic Approach (Joseph P. Olive, Alice Greenwood, John Coleman)

There are five diphtongs in American English, /eʲ/ as in bait, /aʲ/ as
  in bite, /ɔʲ/ as in boy, /aʷ/ as in cow and /oʷ/ as in boat.

Oxford Dictionary marks /ɪə/, /eə/, /ʊə/ as strictly British.
Wikipedia quoting Wells in ""General American English"" article.

When prosodically salient, the lax vowels /ɪ, ʊ, ɛ, ʌ, æ/ tend to be
  realized as centering diphthongs [ɪə, ʊə, ɛə, ʌə, æə] instead of the
  more usual long monophthongs [ɪˑ, ʊˑ, ɛˑ, ʌˑ, æˑ] when they precede a
  word-final voiced consonant, so that the word good in the sentence
  that's very good! tends to be pronounced [ɡʊəd] instead of [ɡʊˑd].

That is why fear [fɪr] may become [fɪər] or poor [pʊr] may become [pʊər] when emphasized just as well. In my humble non-native speaker opinion.
Why, despite all that, do I keep seeing guides like this that insist on existence of these diphthongs in AmE? Is it a sort of alternative theory I'm not aware of, or do these authors interpret diaphonemic notation literally?

",16750,"Is ""freak-out"" an active or a passive experience?","The OED defines the verb freak-out as meaning:


to freak out (occas. without out): to undergo an intense emotional experience, to become stimulated, to rave, esp. under the influence of
  hallucinatory drugs. Also trans., to cause (a person) to be aroused or
  stimulated in such a way. (Also in more trivial uses.) So
  freaked-out adj. affected thus.  freaking-out n.


Examples of freak-out are given from 1965. They stop in 1970, suggesting that this was perhaps a word of the 60s, though I still hear it being used mostly by Americans, a lot during the recent election campaign.
Typically the OED's examples are in both an active and passive context. 

1970   It 27 Feb. 11/1   Aage leaps about and shouts at them and
  freaks them out.
1970   Nature 23 May 704/1   One question asked the respondents how
  often they had seen other people ‘freak out’, that is, have intense,
  transient emotional upsets.

The first of the above is a transitive verb, the second an active intransitive verb.
Sometimes people get freaked-out, sometimes they freak-out. In a newspaper article I have been reading on people who supported Donald Trump, a 25-year-old man, James Morrison says I was freaked out about Hillary because there were 33,000 emails....So, who or what did the freaking-out? Hillary is an indirect object governed by 'about'.
Now that does not sound quite the same sort of thing someone saying they freaked-out because of the 33,000 emails...
So how does the meaning change here between these two uses? Can anyone throw any light on the matter, please? 
Edit. After giving further thought to this and after a helpful dialogue of comments with others, which has better crystallised the issue in my mind, I feel I should re-pose the question. What concerns me is that freaking-out, it seems, can be both a self generated experience (he freaked out) or something that is inflicted upon one (it freaked him out). I cannot for the moment think of any other verbs which behave in quite this way. Can anyone else?

Possible Duplicate:
“Whereäs” as an alternative spelling of “whereas” 

I've got an impression that there is (or was) a rule in English: 
If you have a rarely used word with two vowel letters in a row, corresponding to two vowel sounds in a row (as opposed to a diphthong or single vowel sound marked by two letters), you have to mark a second vowel with a trema.
For example: coöperation.
As rarely used word gets more popular and recognizable, trema is dropped from the spelling. In contemporary English cooperation is spelled without it.

Recommendation for English Grammar books?,"
Possible Duplicate:
What are some of the better English reference grammars? 

I grew up in a non-English speaking country. During my elementary and middle school years, I self-studied the grammar of English via various books written by the most famous experts in my country, although these were beyond what were required by my curriculum. I am not saying my English is good enough now, but the study from the old days still helps me a lot for my life in U.S. later.
After coming to U.S., I have often got my mind boggled by various usages of English either in talks or in prints, which seem to be inconsistent with what I have learned before. In my guess, the reasons can be a combination of any of the following: 

what I have learned is probably
based on British English;
the usage by American is not always
rigorous, which sometimes put me
into the dilemma of which to follow;
I might need some excellent English
grammar books whose authors are
trustworthy experts who are also
native English speaker.

So, my question is, as for my last point, what are your recommendations for English grammar books? I would like to read comprehensive and nice-organized books from being concise, to being detailed. I think books for middle and elementary schools are perhaps not what I am looking for.

",19340,What does 'IN' mean: 'IN your own person or IN the person of any other'?,"Source: Prof Michael Sandel, Justice: ..., Episode 06: ""MIND YOUR MOTIVE"" 

47:30 and here Kant distinguishes between persons on the one hand, and things on the other. 
  47:38: Rational beings are persons that don't just have a relative value for us, but if anything has they have an absolute value, an intrinsic value.
  47:50 That is, rational beings have dignity that are worthy of reverence and respect.
  47:56: This line of reasoning leads Kant to the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative which is this: 

Act in such a way that you always treated humanity,
    ♦ whether in your own person
    or in the person of any other, ♦
    never simply as a means, but always at    the same time,
    as an end. 

48:21: So that's the Formula of Humanity as an End.

Why did Kant (or the German to English translator) use in? I know that the 1st ed. of Critique of Pure Reason was published in German in 1781, but I still want to rationalise or understand this use (even if it's archaic), which would've never occurred to me.
 I would've written the clause surrounded by ♦, as follows instead:

1. ♦ whether yourself or any other person , ♦

I got curious what ride-hailing is, so I opened my dictionary and tried to translate the word into my language. There have been no answers. There seem to be no equivalents in my language. I decided to add this word to a user-contributed dictionary. But, first, I need to understand the idea behind the word. This might help find a similar word in my language. So, I needed to understand what 'ride-hailing' was, and I googled it. 
I have found no reliable sources to explain the word. However, there was a big Wikipedia article on ... hail and ride! The other serious-looking results were mostly about ... 'ride-hailing' and there is even an online dictionary article. Suddenly, I got an idea, an insight. What if both words - hail and ride and  ride-hailing are the same thing simply written in different words? 
In this case, if the connotations - the words - are the same, than ride-hailing means hail and ride and, so I can continue with my little research.
THE QUESTION IS: are ride-hailing and hail and ride the same thing?
HERE IS THE QUOTE from TheGuardian with the original words:

""Uber tripled federal lobbying efforts in 2016, spending $1.36m – a
  whopping $890,000 more than in 2015. These efforts focused on
  modernizing existing laws, including pushing to allow federal
  employees to use 
  ride-hailing
  services when traveling on official
  business.""

So, here they are talking about taxis, and not buses! 

But, then, Wiki talks buses:

In public transport in the United Kingdom and Australia, hail and ride
  is boarding or alighting a mode of public transport by signalling the
  driver or conductor that one wishes to board or alight, rather than
  the more conventional system of using a designated stop. Hail and ride
  is used primarily in bus transport.

Please, help me with your expertise. I understand you can speak different versions of English, so, it would be useful if you mentioned your part of the world.
P.S. The images in this article were borrowed from Business Standard and Transport for London. Also, I got puzzled by the Google image search results where ride-hailing was mainly about taxi, while hail and ride was about both buses and taxis.

If you were to use the ""SE"" acronym instead of ""StackExchange,"" you would probably write: *I read an SE thread the other day about the history of bananas!*  The way in which this differs from my situation is that it's very reasonable to assume that when you write ""SE,"" that you are perfectly fine with the two letters ""ess"" and ""eee"" standing in for ""Stack Exchange,"" much like FCC, SEC, NASDAQ, NATO, etc. completely stand in and are even far more well-known than their longer, official names.
Let's say, however, that you're talking about ""solar-powered asynchronous communication transmission,"" which you abbreviate with ""SPACT"" because you don't want to keep retyping ""solar-powered asynchronous communication transmission,"" not only because you want to be lazy but also because reading those words more than one time every sentence can get in the way of comprehension.  Now, if you were to pronounce this ""ess-pee...etc."" then, of course, you'd say ""an SPACT device,"" but let's say you don't want ""SPACT"" to be referred to, phonetically, by its letters (or even ""SPACT"") and are simply using it as an abbreviation?  Does it retain its indefinite article (""a"") from its original version (""solar-powered asynchronous communication transmission"")?

Flexibilization refers to the changing work practices by which firms no longer use internal labor markets or implicitly promise employees lifetime job security, but rather seek flexible employment relations that permit them to increase or diminish their workforce, and reassign and redeploy employees with ease.
Source: K. V. Stone, 'Flexibilization, Globalization, and Privatization: Three Challenges to Labor Rights in Our Time,' Osgoode Hall Law Journal 44, 77 (2006). (link)

The term is often used in other languages to characterize neoliberal changes in labor and labor policies, including the removal of social protection for workers (such as sick pay and dismissal protection). Importantly, the term flexibilization does not have the negative connotation of neoliberalism. Other than the latter, it is also used by business insiders who argue that companies need to be more flexible to be able to quickly adapt to new challenges.

"Use of ""I"", ""we"" and the passive voice in a scientific thesis","
Possible Duplicate:
Style Question: Use of “we” vs. “I” vs. passive voice in a dissertation 

When the first person voice is used in scientific writing it is mostly used in the first person plural, as scientific papers almost always have more than one co-author, such as

We propose a new method to study cell differentiation in nematodes.

Often the ""we"" also includes the reader

We may see in Figure 4.2 that...

However, I am writing a thesis which means I am the only author and I even have to testify in writing that the work is my own and I did not receive any help other than from the indicated sources. Therefore it seems I should use ""I"", but this seems to be very unusual in scientific writing and even discouraged as one may sound pretentious or self-absorbed. However, the alternative is to use the passive voice, which seems to be even more discouraged as it produces hard to read writing and indeed an entire thesis in the passive voice may be indigestible for any reader.
So far, I used the second form of ""we"" extensively that includes me and the reader. This form is often natural when describing mathematical derivations as the truth is objective and it suggests that I am taking the reader by the hand and walking her through the process. Still, I'm trying not do overdo this form. 
However, eventually I will need to refer to methods that I propose and choices that I have made. Should I just follow scientific convention and use ""we"" although it is factually inaccurate or indeed write in the scorned-upon ""I""?

How to take the gender of an anonymous person into consideration?,"
Possible Duplicate:
Gender neutral pronoun 

Very often, I find myself writing about a user, an anonymous person whose gender I don't know.
Right after mentioning this abstract user, I need to make a reference to the said person, and I often end up using he/she, as a shorter version of he or she.
Example:

Note that the user may get confused by
  the fact that green button turns red
  when he/she presses the blue button.

And then I need to make another reference in another sentence right after that, and I find it heavy to write he/she again... So I write he.
I am confused by this because in French, every single noun has a gender. We don't have any neuter. Utilisateur, which means user in French, is masculine. Whereas personne is feminine.
So I don't have this problem in French. If I talk about a user then I can say he. If I talk about a person, I say she. 
But how to deal properly and elegantly with this situation in English?
Is it acceptable to say he, as when one says man while talking about both men and women in general?

That is, hyphenate if it describes another noun but not if it stands on its own. Does that make sense? Searching for books on Amazon brings up titles with both steady state and steady-state which seem to at least partially conform to this rule.
Or would it be better to just chose either hyphenation or no hyphenation and then stick to that consistently?

This parsing does not make much sense to me. It is saying that feeling toward death that is closest is pain, which is nonsensical. Closest modifies feeling to death.

B. {[Closest feeling] to death} is pain.

This makes much more sense to me, as ""to death"" modifies ""closest feeling"", making it mean that the feeling that is closest to death is the pain. However, I am still unsure about it , since it feels like adjective ""closest"" should be right next to preposition ""to"" as below.


Feeling closest to death is pain.

On the other hand, I find it hard to make the caption read natural and properly describe the contents of the figure without such a noise.
It's easier to fix when the caption is longer, however, I use special short versions of captions for the list of figures. Not only this is harder to fix, but the list of figures appears really bad, because all the ""An example"" and others are lined up.
One difficulty is that omitting ""An example"" has a different meaning, for example 

""An example of a flow network for Lemma 1.2.3."" says that this is just some flow network used to illustrate how the proof works.
""A flow network for Lemma 1.2.3."" means this is a way of realizing the flow network described in the lemma and all such flow networks look essentially like this one (where ""essentially"" is clear from the context).

I've seen a lot of confusion, especially in the IT world. For example WSGI — most often letters names, but it's popularly pronounced as  wizz-gy or even whiskey. Of older examples SQL most often pronounced as letter names, but officially it should be pronounced sequel.

"""can hardly"" vs. ""can't hardly""","

These two seem to be opposites of each other because of the additional ""not"" in one of them. However, they seem to be interchangeable. Are they? What's the difference?
",31271,"In which circumstances is the expression ""I have an ask"" more appropriate than ""I have a request""?","I found the following definition for ask as a noun.

a demand or situation that requires a specified degree of effort or commitment. Example: ""it is a big ask for him to go and play 90 minutes""

Here is an example from a blog post, whose author seems to misuse that above definition. I would have written it as a question, or just omitted ""I have an ask"" to make it simple.

I have an ask: if you hear of anyone coming around to these parts [of the world] , do let me know.

My (possibly) flawed understanding is that it is informal (and borderline incorrect) to use ask as a noun in that context, and that using request should be preferred in about any circumstance. Yet, according to Google Ngrams, its usage has doubled in the past 20 years.
In what cases should one prefer writing ""have an ask"" instead of ""have a request""? I'm sure I'm missing something here.

"""Me being"" versus ""my being""","

Until a few months ago, I had always thought that sentences like this were correct:

They always hated me being an atheist.

Only later to find out that the correct form is:

They always hated my being an atheist.

I came to understand the reason behind this and started using the proper form, but as I've seen the latest futurama episode, I found out the problem is far from over. The main cast character, Fry, said the following:

Never bet against me being stupid.

And now I'm totally lost. I've tried googling for an answer and all I found (by @Cerberus here or by others here, here, here and here) seems to disprove the fact of ""me being"" being correct.
So I ask: did the creators of futurama make such a horrible mistake, or does this problem go deeper than meets the eye?

I guess the second one is correct but I have also heard the first phrase too. That's why I am confused.

I was just writing an email asking a supervisor about downloading multiple dynamic-link library files. The acronym for these is DLL, and the full spelling, dynamic-link library, is never used. How would this be pluralized, because normally I would just add an s, but DLLs is difficult to understand. Sometimes I add an apostrophe to make it DLL's, but I know this isn't grammatically correct. So my question is, how do I make the acronym DLL (and acronyms in general) plural?

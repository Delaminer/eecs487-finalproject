# 487 Final Project

Highly suggest using a virtual environment. Everything should be in requirements.txt:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Mac, getting Tensorflow is a bit tricky, see (here)[https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706] and (here)[https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/700906]

Make sure to add files to .gitignore for datasets as you need! Do not upload GloVe, or the Linguistics dataset, and so on.

# 487 Final Project

Highly suggest using a virtual environment. Everything should be in requirements.txt:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Make sure to add files to .gitignore for datasets as you need! Do not upload GloVe, or the Linguistics dataset, and so on.

"What does Maugham mean by ""his spaghetti were""?","
Possible Duplicate:
Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common? 

[Following up from, but not a duplicate of, this question by another user, which was unresolved…]
Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence contains an unusual (perhaps even unique) usage of English that I'm hoping some native speaker can shed light on. Here is the sentence in bold, with some surrounding sentences for context. Dirk Stroeve has previously been described as ""a painter, but a very bad one"". The narrator says:

In the evenings I went to see my
  friends.  I looked in often on the
  Stroeves, and sometimes shared their
  modest fare.  Dirk Stroeve flattered
  himself on his skill in cooking
  Italian dishes, and I confess that
  his spaghetti were very much
  better than his pictures.  It was a
  dinner for a King when he brought in a
  huge dish of it, succulent with
  tomatoes, and we ate it together with
  the good household bread and a bottle
  of red wine.  I grew more intimate
  with Blanche Stroeve…

Since spaghetti is (almost?) always used in English in the singular as an uncountable (mass) noun, this is unusual. What is the right interpretation of this sentence?

""His spaghetti"" is parallel to ""his omelettes"". That is, it refers to the many occasions he cooked spaghetti, and means something like ""his spaghetti dishes were better than his pictures"". (The OED entry for 'spaghetti' has ""1. a. A variety of pasta made in long thin strings. Occas., a dish of spaghetti."")
As in the original Italian usage, ""spaghetti"" in the plural here refers to multiple strands of spaghetti or pieces of spaghetti.
Something else.

(I am partial to (1.) myself, but this interpretation was described by another user as ""unlikely"" and ""completely absurd"", so I'm trying to know for sure.)
",861,"Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common?","In W. Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence, there is a line about Dirk Stroeve which goes His spaghetti were ….

cannot => can't

In these examples, the o sound in not is dropped and the letter o (no in the case of cannot) is replaced with an apostrophe.

Not once, but twice. As far as I could tell it was not being used tongue in cheek. In the Feb '10 issue, in the article about the Congo Chimps.

Pluralizing keywords in programming languages,"
Possible Duplicate:
Marking plural of code words 

In the language that I'm currently working in one of the keywords is try. I'm writing an error message:

No implementation for global level try statements.

It's too long in my source and so I would very much like to reduce it to

No implementation for global level try's. 

Anybody using my code should understand it very easily as my code is entirely about dynamically determining what exception handling is in place and the try keyword is one of the cornerstones of exception handling in the given language.

Could we pretend for the duration that I'm not being overly picky?
Is this pluralization correct or at least acceptable? Both ""tries"" and ""trys"" look very wrong to me. 
Are there general rules pertaining to pluralizing keywords and other identifiers from programming languages. A quick google search and more extensive search of this site didn't quite do it. I did find this question. The selected answer assumes the presence of markup (not available in my case) and the other answer sidesteps the issue by avoiding pluralizing the words in question. Are there any new insights to be had?  

An answer to (3) would answer (2) of course and so I would be happy with just that. If it's not available though, I would appeciate input on (2). 
",6067,Marking plural of code words,"In my blog (which is about programming) I often use reserved words from different programming languages.
Like this:

When column is nullable in both tables, this query won't return a match of two NULLs for the reasons described above: no NULLs are equal.

Here, NULL is a programming language keyword.
For numerous reasons, I mark them with <code> tag so they are rendered with a fixed width font, not translated into the foreign languages by Google Translate, can easily be seen on the page etc.
In the example above, which would be the best way to mark the plural?

NULLs
NULL s
NULL's
NULLs
NULLS

Option 1 looks ugly on the page (the word and the plural marker are rendered in different colors and fonts)
Option 2 adds a space between the word and the plural marker
Option 3 looks nicest but is not correct
Options 4 and 5 may leave the reader under impression that NULLS is a reserved word (which is not true) and this may be confusing. Also, Google Translate would leave the word as is which would be definitely wrong in other languages.

"What does Maugham mean by ""his spaghetti were""?","
Possible Duplicate:
Was the usage ""Spaghetti were"" ever acceptable or common? 

[Following up from, but not a duplicate of, this question by another user, which was unresolved…]
Somerset Maugham's The Moon and Sixpence contains an unusual (perhaps even unique) usage of English that I'm hoping some native speaker can shed light on. Here is the sentence in bold, with some surrounding sentences for context. Dirk Stroeve has previously been described as ""a painter, but a very bad one"". The narrator says:

In the evenings I went to see my
  friends.  I looked in often on the
  Stroeves, and sometimes shared their
  modest fare.  Dirk Stroeve flattered
  himself on his skill in cooking
  Italian dishes, and I confess that
  his spaghetti were very much
  better than his pictures.  It was a
  dinner for a King when he brought in a
  huge dish of it, succulent with
  tomatoes, and we ate it together with
  the good household bread and a bottle
  of red wine.  I grew more intimate
  with Blanche Stroeve…

Since spaghetti is (almost?) always used in English in the singular as an uncountable (mass) noun, this is unusual. What is the right interpretation of this sentence?

""His spaghetti"" is parallel to ""his omelettes"". That is, it refers to the many occasions he cooked spaghetti, and means something like ""his spaghetti dishes were better than his pictures"". (The OED entry for 'spaghetti' has ""1. a. A variety of pasta made in long thin strings. Occas., a dish of spaghetti."")
As in the original Italian usage, ""spaghetti"" in the plural here refers to multiple strands of spaghetti or pieces of spaghetti.
Something else.

(I am partial to (1.) myself, but this interpretation was described by another user as ""unlikely"" and ""completely absurd"", so I'm trying to know for sure.)

A spirit of enquiry is abroad among the Chinese, and there is a class of students, by no means small in number, who receive with avidity instruction on scientific matters from the West.
After all the bitterness in the game over the past few years, there seemed something of a new spirit abroad, to which the persona of Tony Gilbert, the Borders' Kiwi coach, has contributed.
When traditional people speak of ‘spirits’ that are abroad, they tend to refer to presence such as the wind, or the creative force of a word.



In short, at the top of the new century he caught a new spirit abroad.

PS: Adding some of the research I did before asking the question:
I am asking this question because I read for instance in the British dictionary on dictionary.com:

Nutritious:
  adjective
  1. nourishing, sometimes to a high degree

where ""nourishing"" can be clicked on, with the result:

Nourishing: promoting or sustaining life, growth, or strength

These definitions (or others I can find) are compatible with both the above interpretations ([1] enough (or a lot of) calories, and [2] a variety of nutrients). However, I am asking this question because I implicitly learned from usage (as a non-native speaker) only the first meaning, while a friend (also a non-native speaker) insists that only the second meaning is correct. Since the definitions I can find are somewhat vague, like the above ones (e.g. they are compatible with the idea that nutritious can even refer to things like sleep, which ""promotes or sustains life,…"", which is, as far as I know, not the case), I can't know for sure which, or if both the interpretations above are implied by ""nutritious"".

cannot => can't

In these examples, the o sound in not is dropped and the letter o (no in the case of cannot) is replaced with an apostrophe.

",6039,"How did ""ought"" lose its original usage as the past tense of ""owe""?","Ought is originally the past tense of owe (v.). It appears that this usage is retained in Scottish and in some dialects of English. The current use of ought in standard English is a modal auxiliary (as present or future tense, mainly with to and infinitive).
Etymonline says ought has been detached from owe since 17c. and provides the etymology of ought as below:

Old English ahte ""owned, possessed,"" past tense of agan ""to own, possess; owe"" (see owe). As a past tense of owe, it shared in that word's evolution and meant at times in Middle English ""possessed"" and ""under obligation to pay."" It has been detached from owe since 17c., though he aught me ten pounds is recorded as active in East Anglian dialect c. 1825. As an auxiliary verb expressing duty or moral obligation (the main modern use, attested from late 12c.), it represents the past subjunctive.

Ought, Should. Ought is the stronger, expressing especially obligations of duty, with some weaker use in expressing interest or necessity: as, you ought to know, if any one does. Should sometimes expresses duty: as, we should be careful of others' feelings; but generally expresses propriety, expediency, etc.: as, we should dot our i's and cross our t's.

  Sally and Tom join Tinder at the same time. Both add a single photo of themselves and list their hobbies and family circumstances.  Both Sally and Tom decide to swipe right(like) every photo they see on their screens.
After both have done this for a thousand photos they only return to the app a week later. Sally has 200 mutual likes and message from men of various ages wanting to hook up. Tom has no mutual likes.

As a result Sally has a high expectation of her desirability and Tom forms a very low expectation of his desirability.
One could argue  people are biased for Sally/ biased against  Tom but in a real life scenario if Sally and Tom went independently to a club, Tom would get more  interest shown in him than Sally. So the word(s) I'm looking for is related to a specific scenario/use case i.e. Tinder but not in general.

I think that ""factoid"" is close, but that it doesn't contain enough implied doubt about the truth of the ""fact"" (and is a little disputed in its usage).
Here is a description of the ""facts"" I am referring to and would like to have a term for:

Most importantly, they strive to have a kind of counterintuitive nature or aspect, sometimes ""shock value""
It's probably safer to assume that they are false until proven true (see first point), especially when evaluating them against common sense or general knowledge
They often contain the word ""actually"". They could be presented as ""Did you know..."" sentences
They are akin to overly-shared Facebook posts with questionable legitimacy
They might have begun as a complex truth, but, when presented in short form, they are misleading or no longer true (either because they cannot be shortened, or the speaker did not understand the long form and now believes something false that was not originally there)
Some news outlets try to compose these types of sentences for their headlines, even though the body of the article reveals the truth (and makes me frustrated that the news outlet was unethical enough to title the article in this manner)

At the risk of inciting debate, here are some examples of these types of sentences:

""Actually, Diet Coke is worse for you than regular Coke."" (possibly an example of point #5 above)
""Actually, drinking caffeinated drinks dehydrates you."" (have also heard with 'carbonated')
""Working out is actually bad for you.""
""Electric cars actually harm the environment.""
""Everything you see in the world is actually on a 10-15 second delay.""

Please refrain from arguing about the truth of these particular statements- I only provide them as examples to show the type of sentence I'm talking about. I hear sentences like these all the time, but I don't know how to describe them or lump them all together succinctly.
The next time I have a friend walk up to me while I'm tying my shoes and say something stupid like, ""Actually, tying your shoes makes them fall off more easily,"" I want to be able to say, ""No, that's just a ________________,""* and keep tying my shoes.
*it doesn't have to fit the blank in that sentence exactly

"What is the possessive form of ""what""?","
Possible Duplicate:
'Which', 'whose' or something else?

First of all, I'm not a native speaker so I can't rely on my intuition in this specific case.
For a very long time I was sure that ""whose"" was the widely used possessive form of both ""who"" and ""what"". But at one point someone told me that the correct possessive of ""what"" is actually ""which"". This sounded extremely awkward, like ""the car which door got scratched"", and yet over the years I actually encountered sentences like this two or three times.
So, could someone clear this up please? Is ""whose"" the only correct possessive of ""what"", or is ""which"" also correct? In which case, has ""which"" become obsolete or does it still feel acceptable to native speakers?
Examples of the use of ""which"" like this:

[a program setting setting] could also exclude folders, which path does not match the path specified in the switch
(source, probably non-native Russian)

VCS trigger rules allow to specify the set of files which changes should trigger the build.
